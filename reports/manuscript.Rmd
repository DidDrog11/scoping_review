## Introduction


Rodents (Rodentia) are abundant and diverse, representing around 40% of the total number of mammalian species [@american_society_of_mammologists_asm_2021]. Rodents typically demonstrate ‘fast’ life history strategies characterised by early maturation, short generation times, low juvenile and adult survival and high fecundity [@dobson_fast_2007]. There is a degree of between-species heterogeneity, with commensal species and those that are reservoirs of zoonoses having traits consistent with faster life histories (Han et al., 2015). Rodents often compete with humans for food produced in agricultural systems [@fiedler_rodent_1988], with 5-10% of rodent species classed as major pests. Commensal species thrive in human adapted landscapes nesting in houses and obtaining nutrition from human food storage and preparation areas. In sub-Saharan Africa, Mastomys spp. and Arvicanthis spp. are identified as causing a significant burden as agricultural pests [@stenseth_mice_2003]. Crop loss within Afro-Malagasy small-holder farming communities is high, with 15% of pre-harvest crop being lost to rodent pest activity [@swanepoel_systematic_2017].

Another important issue is the transmission of infectious diseases from rodents to humans. Zoonotic diseases (i.e. animal pathogens that impact human health) are transmitted via two pathways – a direct and an indirect pathway. The direct transmission pathway involves transmission of pathogens through rodents biting or scratching a human, or through contamination of food or water sources. The indirect pathway involves rodents acting as amplifying hosts for ectoparasites that themselves are vectors of zoonoses [@meerburg_rodent-borne_2009]. Several rodent-borne pathogens are global in their distribution, including bacteria such as Lyme disease (caused by *Borrelia burgdorferi*) and Leptospirosis (caused by *Leptospira spp.*) and parasites such as Toxoplasmosis (caused by *Toxoplasma gondii*) and Leishmaniasis (caused by *Leishmania spp.*). However, most rodent-borne pathogens have more limited geographic distributions, particularly viral diseases such as Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (caused by Hantaviridae) concentrated in the Americas and Lassa fever (caused by Arenaviridae) limited to West Africa.

Given the significant economic and public health burden of rodents, monitoring rodent distributions is therefore an ongoing focus of research efforts across multiple scientific disciplines, including (but not limited to) conservation science, development studies and infectious disease epidemiology. The distribution of rodent populations can be monitored via rodent trapping efforts, with traps deployed in habitats expected to contain rodent species of interest.

There is increasing interest in the link between environmental and human factors and rodent populations to land use change and human population change. A recent review of studies included in the PREDICTS database [@hudson_predicts_2014] identified that land use change from primary (i.e. intact forests) to managed and urban systems is associated with a change in rodent assemblages towards species that are more likely to be hosts of zoonoses [@gibb_zoonotic_2020]. *Mastomys natalensis populations* in Tanzania, East Africa are sensitive to seasonal meteorological cycles, in years with below average rainfall and short wet seasons population density is lower [@makundi_reproduction_2007]. Future climate change projections include longer and wetter West African monsoon seasons which could lead to increased zoonotic disease host rodent populations [@akinsanola_projection_2019]. As West Africa contains several known rodent zoonotic reservoirs (e.g. *Mastomys natalensis* and *Arvicanthus niloticus*) and several potential reservoirs of zoonotic diseases (e.g. *Lemniscomys striatus*), this will be the geographic region of interest in this work.

To date there has been no comprehensive overview of rodent trapping studies conducted in West Africa. The aim of this scoping review is therefore to synthesise the knowledge on rodent distributions throughout West Africa obtained from trapping studies.

We specifically aim to address the following research questions :

  +	RQ1: In which West African countries or regions have rodent trapping studies been performed?
  + RQ2: What are the stated aims of these rodent trapping studies?
  + RQ3: Which rodent species are being targeted for trapping activities? Are species with high potential for hosting zoonotic pathogens targeted at higher rates?
  + RQ4: How is the type of land use and/or land use intensity classified in the literature and are classifications comparable across studies?
  +	RQ5: Is rodent trapping occurring in all habitat types or are some habitats targeted at higher rates?
  +	RQ6: Is there an association of land use change, human population change or the implementation of regulatory strategies with rodent species distributions?

## Methods


### Study design

  + Scoping review
  + Protocol pre-registered on the [Openscience Framework](...)

### Eligibility criteria

  + Studies were included if:
    + Trapping of small mammals including at least one species of Rodentia.
    + Descriped trap used, length of trapping activity or location of trapping activity.
    + Included trapping activity from at least one West African country: Benin, Burkina-Faso, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo
    + Recorded as outcome genus or species of trapped individual
    + Were available in English
    + Published in a peer-reviewed journal, a pre-print manuscript or a report by a an identifiable organisation/consultancy
  + Studies were excluded if:
    + Data were duplicated from a previously included study (i.e. secondary data analysis)
    + No full text were available

### Search strategy

The following terms were searched for in OVID Medline, Web of Science (Core collection and Zoological Record), JSTOR, BioOne, African Journals Online, Global Health and the pre-print servers BioRxiv and EcoEvoRxiv:

  1. Rodent
  2. West Africa
  3. 1. AND 2.

Other resources including the UN Official Documents System, Open Grey, AGRIS FAO and Google Scholar were searched using combinations of the following terms:

  1. Rodent
  2. Rodent Trap*
  3. West Africa

Additional articles were identified through references within included articles and reports known to the study team. Searches were completed on 2021-03-01.

### Selection of studies

One reviewer screened titles, abstracts and full texts against the inclusion criteria. A random subset of each of these (10%) were reviewed by a second  reviewer.

### Data extraction

Data were extracted by one reviewer. A second reviewer verified a subset (10%) of included studies. A data extraction form was maintained on a Google sheets document. Data extracted included i) study identifiers; ii) study aims; iii) trapping methodology; iv) geolocation data; v) method of speciation; vi) trapping locations and dates; vii) trapped species; viii) number of trap-nights and ix) microorganisms of interest.

### Study aims

Where explicity stated the study aims were extracted. For those with no recorded aims the specific aims were inferred from the background or conclusions of manuscript or report. The aims of the studies were broadly categorised as pertaining to rodent ecology research or studies on risk of zoonoses. Within these subdivisions the aim were further subdivided into the following categories:
  
  + Rodent ecology
    + Cat 1
    + Cat 2
  + Zoonoses risk
    + Cat 1
    + Cat 2

### Trapping methodology

The brand or description of the rodent trap was obtained from each study that reported this. For those using multiple devices all types were recorded.

### Geolocation of trapping activity

GPS locations were extracted for the most precise location presented i.e. trap, trap-line, study-site or study region. Locations were extracted in the format reported and converted to decimal degrees. Where no GPS location is reported coordinates will be matched to study locations using the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency NGA GEOnet Names Server [] based on study site name/region and through maps presented in the manuscript.

### Genus and species definitions

Designations of species change over time as new evidence emerges. As included studies span 45 years disambiguation of historical species names was performed using Taxize...

## Results

A total of 2,200 records were identified, with 101 studies included in narrative synthesis (see Figure \@ref(fig:prisma)).

``` {r prisma, fig.cap = "Flow diagram of records returned from the search strategy. Reasons for exclusion of studies at the full text stage are given.", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "figure_1.png"))
```

The earliest studies identified were from 1974 with the majority (62%) published since 2010. Most of the included studies were classified as rodent ecology research (54%) with the remainder studies on zoonotic diseases (46%).

### Location of studies

The included studies trapped in 16 countries, however, three countries were outside of the scope of this study (Cameroon, Chad and Morocco). At least a single trap site was recorded from 13 West African countries, with no rodent trapping reported from Gambia, Cape Verde or Togo. 

Most studies (95%) were conducted in a single country, three studies were conducted in two countries, three studies were conducted in five countries and one study was conducted across six countries. This lead to 124 trapping activities being reported across the 13 West African countries. More trapping activity was reported from Senegal (20%) than any other country. Ghana (12%) and Guinea (12%) were the next most frequently trapped countries, followed by Nigeria (9%), Benin, Mali and Niger (7%), Sierra Leone (6%), Mauritania and the Ivory Coast (4%), Burkina Faso and Liberia (2%), Guinea-Bissau had a single recorded trapping activity. 

The trapping activity from the included studies was spread across 1,171 study sites. Twenty-four (24%) studies reported trapping only occurring at a single study site, 34 (33%) studies trapped at between two and five study sites the remaining 44 studies trapped at between six and 93 study sites. Trap sites were mapped to level one country administrative regions and density of sites per million square kilometers was calculated (see Figure \@ref(fig:density)). The areas with highest trapping densities included the capital cities of Niger, Sierra Leone, Senegal, Benin, Mali, Ghana and the Ivory Coast. Of the areas not incorporating capital cities Northern Senegal (Fatique, Thies, Saint-Louis and Kedougou), Southern Guinea (Kindia and Nzerejore) and Eastern Sierra Leone were most intensively studied. Mapping to level two administrative regions is displayed in Supplementary figure \@ref(fig:supfig1).

```

### Trap types

Of the included studies 15 did not state the type of trap used with three studies reporting supplementary hand trapping of rodents alongside trap use. For the remaining studies three used more than four types of rodent traps, seven used three types, 31 used two types the remaining 45 studies used a single trap type. The most commonly used trap was the Sherman trap (67%) [] which is available in several sizes, locally made wire mesh traps were used in 29 studies (34%), less commonly used trap types included the Museum special, Tomahawk, Victor, Snaptraps and Firobind traps.

### Trap setup

Thirty-three studies did not describe the setup of traps. Twenty five studies placed transect lines of traps through study sites with thirteen studies placing traps along a line but not clearly describing a transect across a defined site. Sixteen studies purposefully sample houses, with four further studies purposefully placing traps in targeted locationes. Nine studies placed traps in a grid across single or multiple habitat types. Three studies described a stratified or randomised approach to placing traps. Trap setup was typically reported for ecology studies (80%) with transect lines the most commonly used approach. Trap setup was reported in 53% of zoonoses risk studies with purposeful placement of traps in houses the most common approach (20%).

### Trapping effort

Trapping effort was variably reported in included studies. Thirty studies did not report trapping effort. Thirty-six studies reported a measure of trapping effort at the same level of detail at which they reported rodent captures. Thirty-five studies reported incomplete data on trapping effort (i.e. number of study nights or total number of trap-nights). Trapping effort was more completely reported from ecology studies (53% complete information and 20% no information) compared to zoonoses risk studies (15% complete information and 41% no information).

### Species identification

Nine included studies did not describe the method used to identify trapped rodents. Most studies (52%) relied solely on morphometric identification against taxonomic keys or museum voucher specimens. Eight studies described molecular identification of rodents with 30% using a combination of morphological and molecular techniques. In more recently published studies (since 2010) 54% used molecular techniques to assist with speciation, compared with less than 16% in studies published before 2010.

### Reported species and species abundance

Across all West African study sites there were 59,343 trapped small mammals (592 were trapped outside of West Africa), 2,830 (4.8%) trapped individuals were identified to order level (Rodentia), 5,329 (9%) were identified to genus level, the remaining 51,184 (86%) were identified to species level. Of the 131 distinct identified species trapped (see Supplementary table 1) the majority were from the order Rodentia (102) with Muridae (83) being the largest family of rodents, followed by Gliridae (6), Nesomyidae (4), Sciuridae (3), Ctenodactylidae (2) and Anomaluridae, Dipodidae, Hystricidae and Thryonomidae (all 1). The remaining 29 species came from the orders of the Soricomorpha (25), Erinaceomorpha (3) and a single Afrosoricida. 

More individuals were trapped in studies conducted to investigate the risk of zoonoses (35,892, 60%) than from ecology studies (23,451 40%). Animals trapped as part of ecological research were more often identified to species level (93%) than those trapped in zoonoses research (82%). The most commonly trapped genera of rodents were *Mastomys sp.* (22,665, 39.7%), *Rattus sp.* (7,718, 13.5%), *Mus sp.* (7,317, 12.8%), *Praomys sp.* (4,887, 8.6%) and *Arvicanthis sp.* (4,408, 7.72%). At the species level *Mastomys natalensis* (10,419, 20.2%) and *Mastomys erythroleucus* (7,184, 13.9%) were the most commonly trapped rodents, *Rattus rattus* (6,229, 12.1%), *Mus musculus* (6,030, 11.8%), *Arvicanthis niloticus* (4,101, 8%) and *Mastomys huberti* (3,106, 6%) made up the next most commonly trapped species. Presence and absence maps for these six most commonly trapped species are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:dist).
