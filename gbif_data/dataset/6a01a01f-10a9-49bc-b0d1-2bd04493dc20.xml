    <abstract>
        <para>Data on animal species  were  collected during wildlife census by fauna guards and ecological staff on linear transects and the transects dedicated for KAI estimation. The  geographical coordinates were systematically registered  using GPS and all the ecological information and signs of threats on wildlife were recorded  on field sheets  by team leaders during the observations. A total number of  4295 occurrence data on animal  species were recorded</para>

          <abstract>
              <para>Based on a national survey on biodiversity data holders and users across Benin, project researchers discovered that large reserves of biodiversity data form Benin remain unpublished: the National Herbarium (University of Abomey-Calavi, UAC) and the General Direction of Forest and Natural Resource Management (Ministry of Environment) each holds at least 50,000 plant and animal records, and the biodiversity center of IITA – Benin holds more than 200,000 insect specimens. Moreover, owing to colonial-era biodiversity exploration and documentation, even more of the relevant data on Beninese biodiversity resides outside of the country, in largest part in museums and herbaria in France and elsewhere. These resources thus represent an opportunity to dramatically increase the availability of information for the country.  This JRS grant award to UAC follows on to a grant awarded in 2011 to the National Biodiversity Institute of Costa Rica (INBio), to provide technical assistance to UAC to establish the digitization equipment, protocols, and data publishing software.</para>

                    <para>The design is detailed according tp the objectives of the project
1.	Extend and consolidate partnerships with institutions working in the field of biodiversity in Benin. This objective will be achieved during the first 18 months of the project, including at least 70% of the major institutions, through sensitization on the importance of biodiversity data publication and training of targeted staff members. Where required, the project will provide financial assistance to support data mobilization. 

2.	Mobilize more plant and animal data. This objective will be achieved during the first 18 months of the project by digitizing and publishing at least 50,000 geo-referenced animal and plant collections (Magnoliophyta, Pteridophyta, vertebrates, key insect groups) of partner institutions. Data mobilization will occur in the framework of GBIF procedures and standards. As a consequence, the NBIS portal will become the ‘go-to’ source of biodiversity information for the country.

3.	Mobilize global data for Benin. This objective will be achieved during the first 21 months of the project, but largely within the framework of another project to be submitted. We are building a West African digitization consortium via a formal partnership with researchers and institutions in Ghana, Togo, Nigeria, and Cameroon. Within this consortium, we will develop broad cooperation and collaboration with European and North American museums and herbaria for effective capture, repatriation, cleaning, georeferencing, and sharing of at least 50% of data from ‘frozen’ European and American museum collections regarding Benin (and West Africa more generally).

4.	Advance Beninese capacity in biodiversity analyses. This objective will be achieved throughout the project and beyond. My institution has signed an MOU with Kansas University (KU) to enable high-level scientific and technical assistance from the team of Dr Perterson to several universities in Benin. This assistance will help incorporate biodiversity informatics into Masters degree programs in Benin. Beninese students to be trained in the Ph.D. program at KU will be recruited at universities of Benin to carry on biodiversity informatics training and develop detailed case studies relevant to decision-making in biodiversity conservation in Benin.</para>
