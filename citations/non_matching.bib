  Abstract = {Accurate data on the Lassa virus (LASV) human case fatality rate (CFR) and the prevalence of LASV in humans, rodents and other mammals are needed for better planning of actions that will ultimately reduce the burden of LASV infection in sub-Saharan Africa. In this systematic review with meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Scopus, Africa Journal Online, and African Index Medicus from 1969 to 2020 to obtain studies that reported enough data to calculate LASV infection CFR or prevalence. Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently. We extracted all measures of current, recent, and past infections with LASV. Prevalence and CFR estimates were pooled using a random-effect meta-analysis. Factors associated with CFR, prevalence, and sources of between-study heterogeneity were determined using subgroup and metaregression analyses. This review was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020166465. We initially identified 1,399 records and finally retained 109 reports that contributed to 291 prevalence records from 25 countries. The overall CFR was 29.7\% (22.3–37.5) in humans. Pooled prevalence of LASV infection was 8.7\% (95\% confidence interval: 6.8–10.8) in humans, 3.2\% (1.9–4.6) in rodents, and 0.7\% (0.0–2.3) in other mammals. Subgroup and metaregression analyses revealed a substantial statistical heterogeneity explained by higher prevalence in tissue organs, in case-control, in hospital outbreak, and surveys, in retrospective studies, in urban and hospital setting, in hospitalized patients, and in West African countries. This study suggests that LASV infections is an important cause of death in humans and that LASV are common in humans, rodents and other mammals in sub-Saharan Africa. These estimates highlight disparities between sub-regions, and population risk profiles. Western Africa, and specific key populations were identified as having higher LASV CFR and prevalence, hence, deserving more attention for cost-effective preventive interventions.},

  Abstract = {A total of 27 460 trap days were distributed between eight habitat types chosen to represent the major land uses in the study area where primary tropical rain forest is being felled to make way for agriculture. Using three types of break-back traps 1169 small rodents were caught, the commonest species being Praomys tullbergi (487 specimens) with Lophuromys sikapusi second (281 specimens). The remaining 401 specimens comprised twelve species. Weights, measurements and reproductive details were taken of each specimen. The distribution of larger rodents not caught in traps, but exposed as a result of bulldozed clearance of their habitat is discussed. The removal of high forest and its replacement by agriculture and domestic housing increased the numbers, biomass and diversity of small rodents. Seasonal changes in trap success were noted, but the patterns differed from one habitat to another. In general, more rodents were trapped during the rains of the second quarter than during the dry months of the first quarter of the year. Seasonal changes in the breeding of two rodent species were also noted although they differed from each other, and speculations on the reasons why the rodent population varied from habitat to habitat are discussed.},

  Abstract = {Ouagadougou, the capital city of Burkina Faso, was recognized as a focus of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniosis in April 2000. Leishmania major was the only strain isolated in this focus. We conducted a prospective study to detect L. major in rodents, animals which are described as reservoir of the parasite. Rodents were caught in five city areas from November 2005 to October 2006. Giemsa stained smears were realized from the cutaneous lesions when present after macroscopic examination of external lesions. The spleen of each rodent was sterilely removed and split into 3 parts for microscopic examination of smears, culture on NNN media and PCR, respectively. A total of 101 rodents belonging to 9 genera were trapped. All the direct examinations and cultures were negative. By using PCR of lesions and spleen samples, three animals were found infected by L. major: one out of 24 (4.2\%) Mastomys natalensis; one out of 8 (12.5\%) Taterillus sp. and one out of three Cricetomys gambianus. This is the first detection of L. major in rodent species in Burkina Faso. Further studies are needed to confirm their role as reservoirs of L. major.},

  Abstract = {The aim of the current study was to reveal the breeding ecology of Crowned Eagles in western Tanzania through constant daytime monitoring. The breeding circumstances of three resident pairs in the focal study area suggest that the breeding cycle of the species is seasonal, because they lay eggs in the dry season, so that fledging occurs in the rainy season. One pair brought a total of 88 prey items (a minimum of 80 prey individuals) during the breeding period from nest-making to the point at which the nestling was about to fledge at 106 days old. Prey animals comprised three vertebrate taxa (mammal, reptile and bird), of which mammals dominated, ranging over Primates, rodents, carnivores, hyraxes and bovids. Diversity of prey taxa increased in the later stage of the nestling period. As well as breeding periodicity and prey selectivity, I describe details of some novel behaviours related to breeding ecology of the species, such as nest material delivery, copulation, feeding behaviour, unilateral eye closure, alert behaviour and defensive behaviour.},

  Abstract = {Grasscutter (Thryonomys swinderianus) has been a subject of domestication for the past several decades in West and Central Africa. In Ghana, attempts are being made to intensify the domestication efforts because grasscutter meat is a delicacy and huge agribusiness opportunities are expected. Tameness and reproductive ability are two important traits that underlie any successful animal domestication event. Androgen receptor gene has been reported to influence behaviour and fertility. The objective of this study was to identify genetic polymorphism in the androgen receptor gene that is likely to influence tameness and reproductive traits. Tissue samples were collected from a total of 116 including 81 domestic and 35 wild grasscutters in Accra and Mankessim, respectively, and genotyped at the androgen receptor glutamine repeat (ARQ) locus. Results of this study showed that ARQ ranges from six to 19 repeats and heterozygosities (H) were 0.769 and 0.778 for domestic and wild females respectively, indicating that this locus is highly polymorphic in grasscutters. As this locus influences transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor gene, these polymorphisms could influence tameness and reproductive traits in grasscutter. However, further studies are required to test the association of these polymorphisms with phenotypes.},

  Volume = {71},
  Year = {2017},
  Abstract = {The ability to differentiate among conspecifics on the basis of genetic relatedness can be advantageous in kin and mate selection. Selection of mates that are of an intermediate degree of relatedness maximizes the propagation of shared genes to offspring, while minimizing the accumulation of deleterious recessive alleles that can result from close inbreeding. Odors produced from various glandular surfaces of the body have been shown to influence discrimination of conspecifics in numerous taxa, including the order Rodentia. We investigated whether female Cape ground squirrels (Xerus inauris) discriminate between the odors of familiar and foreign males by conducting scent experiments. We simultaneously presented odors that had been collected on acrylic cubes from the anal gland of a familiar (non-dispersed) and a foreign male as well as an unscented control, and recorded the response of focal pregnant and non-pregnant females (n = 19). Non-pregnant females responded differently to the odors of the scent cubes, sniffing the scent collected from the foreign male significantly longer than either the familiar male or control odor, whereas there was no difference in the response of pregnant females. We conclude that male familiarity may influence female mate choice, as familiarity is reliably correlated with relatedness in this population. Based on prior knowledge about the social behavior of Cape ground squirrels, the ability to discriminate between familiar and foreign males may be used by females as an inbreeding avoidance mechanism, as close inbreeding can be avoided by mating with foreign males.},

  Abstract = {An individual's survival and fitness depend on its ability to effectively allocate its time between competing behaviors. Sex, social tactic, season and food availability are important factors influencing activity budgets. However, few field studies have tested their influences. The African striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio) lives in highly seasonal habitats in southern Africa, and individuals can adopt different social tactics. We investigated seasonal changes in activity budgets of different tactics and predicted that individuals will reduce their activity in the non-breeding season to save energy when food availability is low and that young non-breeding adults ('philopatrics') invest mainly in activities related to gaining body mass to increase survival probability. We predicted old adults ('breeders'), which bred during the previous breeding season, to invest mainly in maintenance of their social status. We conducted 90 focal observations during the non-breeding season and 73 during the breeding season. Activity budgets of striped mice were season and tactic specific, with philopatrics, but not breeders, reducing activity when food availability was low, possibly to decrease energy expenditure. Philopatrics of both sexes foraged and basked more in the breeding season than during the non-breeding season. Male philopatrics gained body mass and female philopatrics maintained their body mass in both seasons. Sex-specific differences occurred during the breeding season, when female breeders foraged more than male breeders, while male breeders chased other individuals more than female breeders. These findings indicate that individuals adopting different social tactics display distinct behaviors to fulfill tactic-specific energetic needs.},

  Volume = {457},
  Year = {2016},
  Abstract = {The archaeological and paleontological records from the west coast of South Africa have potential to provide insights into ecosystem dynamics in the region during the mid-Pleistocene. Although the fossil record suggests an ecosystem quite different than that of the region today, we understand little about the ecological factors that contributed to this disparity. The site of Elandsfontein (EFT) dates to between 1.0 and 0.6 million years ago (Ma), preserves in situ lithic and faunal materials found in direct association with each other, and provides the rare opportunity to examine the relationship between hominin behavioral variability and landscape heterogeneity in a winter rainfall ecosystem. In this study, we examine the stable carbon isotopic composition of a large sample (n = 81) of Cape dune mole-rats (Bathyergus suillus) and contemporaneous large mammals ({\textgreater}6 kg; n = 194) from EFT. We find that [delta]13C values of B. suillus are significantly different to those of contemporaneous large mammals from EFT indicating a significant presence of plants utilizing the C4 photosynthetic pathway during the mid-Pleistocene, in contrast to present C3 dominated ecosystems along the west coast of South Africa. Additionally, we find that artifact density at EFT localities is positively correlated with [delta]13C values in B. suillus enamel suggesting that evidence of more intense hominin occupation may be associated with the presence of more C4 vegetation. Lastly, we hypothesize that this unique distribution of vegetation 1) provided abundant resources for both hominin and non-hominin taxa and 2) may have concentrated hominin and animal behavior in certain places on the ancient landscape.

  Abstract = {The genus Jaculusis distributed in Palearctic desert and semi-desert areas, extending from Central Asia to the Western Sahara in the North Africa. In Iran three species of threetoed Jerboa have been reported: Jaculus jaculus from the south west and west of Iran, Jaculus blanfordi from the northeast, east and central part of Iran and Jaculus thaleri from the east of Iran. In present study, the phylogenetic and taxonomic relationships in the genus Jaculus from Iran were examined using molecular, geometric morphometric and morphologic data. Our molecular analyses indicated two monophyletic clades which contain J. jaculus and J. blanfordi. There is a high amount of genetic interspecific distance (12.7\%) between J. jaculus and J. blanfordi, while the intraspecific divergence within these two species is low. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) of morphometric variables were significant (P{\textless}0.05) and shows that J. jaculus is significantly smaller than J. blanfordi. Statistical Analysis on outline data shows that there is an intraspecific geographic variation in 2nd lower molar shape in J. blanfordi so that northern populations are determinable from the south ones (Pvalue= 0.016). Although the findings strengthen an idea of presence of two subspecies in northeast and southeast of Iran, it would require further studies. In this study, expansion of J. jaculus to the center of Iran, suggests that it is sympatric with J. blanfordi in Esfahan province.},

  Abstract = {West Nile Virus infection is a sporadic disease caused by flavivirus. It is seen in horse, human, different mammalian and bird species and some rodents. West Nile Virus is transmitted and maintained by blood-sucking insects like mosquitoes. Many of bird species are infected by vectors by blood sucking. Infected birds play role in transmitting the virus over long distances. Human and horses are high level susceptible to infection, and fever, neurological infection and meningoencephalitis can occur with the progress of the infection. The disease is endemic in Africa and some of Asia countries, but in recent years it is also encountered in Europe and in the Western hemisphere. Eliminating of mosquitoes is important in the prevention of disease. For vaccination, vaccine containing genetically modified virus strains or inactivated viruses can be used for horses and birds. In this review, the West Nile Virus infection is discussed in terms of etiology and epidemiology, epizootiyology, pathogenesis and pathology, clinical, laboratory and necropsi findings, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, treatment, protection and control individually.},

  Title = {Influences on the stable oxygen and carbon isotopes in gerbillid rodent teeth in semi-arid and arid environments: {Implications} for past climate and environmental reconstruction.},
  Volume = {428},
  Year = {2015},
  Abstract = {The stable isotope composition of small mammal tissues has the potential to provide detailed information about terrestrial palaeoclimate and environments, because their remains are abundant in palaeontological and archaeological sites, and they have restricted home ranges. Applications to the Quaternary record, however, have been sparse and limited by an acute lack of understanding of small mammal isotope ecology, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. Here we document the oxygen and carbon isotope composition of Gerbillinae (gerbil) tooth apatite across a rainfall gradient in northwestern Africa, in order to test the relative influences of the 18O/16O in precipitation or moisture availability on gerbil teeth values, the sensitivity of tooth apatite 13C/12C to plant responses to moisture availability, and the influence of developmental period on the isotopic composition of gerbil molars and incisors. The results show that the isotopic composition of molars and incisors from the same individuals differs consistent with the different temporal periods reflected by the teeth; molar teeth are permanently rooted and form around the time of birth, whereas incisors grow continuously. The results indicate that tooth choice is an important consideration for applications as proxy Quaternary records, but also highlights a new potential means to distinguish seasonal contexts. The oxygen isotope composition of gerbil tooth apatite is strongly correlated with mean annual precipitation (MAP) below 600 mm, but above 600 mm the teeth reflect the oxygen isotope composition of local meteoric water instead. Predictably, the carbon isotope composition of the gerbil teeth reflected C3 and C4 dietary inputs, however arid and mesic sites could not be distinguished because of the high variability displayed in the carbon isotope composition of the teeth due to the microhabitat and short temporal period reflected by the gerbil. We show that the oxygen isotope composition of small mammal teeth strongly reflects moisture availability in semi-arid and arid environments and would provide an excellent record of palaeo-aridity in a terrestrial setting. The results illustrate that an understanding of an animal's physiology is essential for interpreting the animal's isotopic responses to external contexts, especially in arid zones.

The dominant erinaceid is Galerix, which is also known from Europe, Turkey, and East Africa. We document a new early species of Galerix, Galerix wesselsae, in sites from Sehwan, the Zinda Pir Dome, the Potwar Plateau, and Banda Daud Shah ranging in age from about 19 to 14 Ma. This species briefly co-occurs with and is then replaced by the smaller Galerix rutlandae, previously based on a few teeth from Daud Khel. G. rutlandae is a common element of Chinji Formation faunas through about 11.5 Ma. Scanty material of an apparently new species of Schizogalerix succeeds Galerix. After 10.2 Ma, no galericines occur in Pakistan, but rare erinaceines are later faunal components.},

  Abstract = {Nutria (Myocastor coypus) is a native aquatic rodent to South America, and was introduced to Europe, Asia, Africa and North America for fur farming. The South American nutria or coypu is now considered a pest in the area of introduction, because of its negative impact on biological diversity and ecological relationships. Having information on the invasion range of exotic species is crucial for understanding the ecology of invasive spread and for making good conservation and management planning to address this problem. At the beginning of the 20th century, nutria was introduced into Asia. Nutria was recorded for the first time in Iran in 1995. In the present study we proposed a multiple spatial scale approach to predict the invasion trends of the nutria in Iran, and to define up the "suitable scale" for predicting the invasion trends of this species. Our results highlighted the importance of environmental variables including vegetation density (for food and nesting) and water resource (streams, rivers, and lakes) in distribution of the nutria. Potential areas for the presence of the nutria are located near the Caspian Sea, west and central Iran which receive more precipitation than other parts of the country. Therefore, these parts of Iran may face a much greater risk of invasion risk in the future. Moreover, these results can show the possible risk of nutria invasion to the northern and western neighbors of Iran. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract = {This study aimed to compare mandibular parameters in adult males and females of Greater cane rat or African cane rat (Thryonomys swinderianus). For this purpose, 9lateral mandibular landmarks were analysed by means of geometric morphometrics. Based on data, and exclusion of the size related component of shape variation, males and females can be clearly discriminated according to mandible shape. In males the ventral point of first incisor alveolus tends to be more cranial, whereas the mental foramen presented a more caudal displacement in females, which moreover demonstrated a more slender mandible. Main biomechanical points (mandibular ramus flexure) showed no differences between genders. It may be concluded that morphological differences the in the mandible of both sexes of T. swinderianus are not due to a functional reasons, as masticatory behaviour would be. This is the first time to the best of our knowledge that geometric morphometric comparison of mandibles in this African rodent is reported, which has enabled the inference of identical biomechanical forces in males and females.},

The microfaunas, especially the rodents, of which there are at least 8 genera, indicate that the limestones accumulated slightly earlier than the oldest mammalian levels of the Fayum, Egypt (Priabonian) meaning that the deposits are likely to be Bartonian.

Here we demonstrate the ability of an insecticide delivery tube that is made from inexpensive locally available materials to reduce fleas on domestic rodents. Unbaited tubes were treated with either an insecticide alone (fipronil) or in conjunction with an insect growth regulator ((S)-methoprene), and placed along natural rodent runways within participant huts. Performance was similar for both treatments throughout the course of the study, and showed significant reductions in the proportion of infested rodents relative to controls for at least 100 d posttreatment.},

  Volume = {71},
  Year = {2014},
  Abstract = {The Eastern Afromontane region of Africa is characterized by striking levels of endemism and species richness accompanied by significant conservation threat, a pattern typical across biodiversity hotspots. Using multi-locus molecular data under a coalescent species tree framework we identify major cryptic biogeographic patterns within and between two endemic montane small mammal species complexes, Hylomyscus mice and Sylvisorex shrews, co-distributed across the Albertine Rift and Kenya Highlands of the Eastern Afromontane Biodiversity Hotspot (EABH). Hypotheses put forward to account for the high diversity of the region include retention of older palaeo-endemic lineages across major regions in climatically stable refugia, as well as the accumulation of lineages associated with more recent differentiation between allopatric populations separated by unsuitable habitat during periods of Pleistocene aridification. Sympatric pairs of sister lineages were found to have significantly older divergence times than allopatric pairs. Genetic analyses and historical distribution modeling suggest that regional meta-populations have persisted since the Pliocene to mid-Pleistocene across a climatic gradient from the Albertine Rift in the west to the Kenya Highlands in the east for both focal taxa. Differing patterns of regional sub-division and demographic expansion were detected and are consistent with differing life histories as well as shared responses to regional variation in stability of suitable habitat. There is also strong support in both mice and shrew species for Late Miocene divergence with subsequent range expansion into sympatry in previously unidentified cryptic species pairs. These results highlight the broad temporal scale at which climatic and geological changes may have facilitated rare dispersal events between montane habitats as well as the long-term persistence of populations in both the Albertine Rift and the Kenyan Highlands that together contributed to the high species diversity and endemism in the EABH.

We examined whether harassment was part of alloparental care by comparing harassment behaviours among different age and sex classes in Cape ground squirrel social groups. We also assessed how individuals adjusted their behaviour dependent on levels of risk by examining the Cape ground squirrel's harassment behaviour among non-venomous, and two species of venomous snakes. We found adult females with emerged juvenile offspring took the most risk, harassing for longer durations and at higher intensities than other group members, suggesting that snake harassment was a maternal behaviour. Females with juvenile offspring only harassed the highest risk elapid snake but increased vigilance and inspection with increasing snake risk suggesting that the Cape ground squirrel can discriminate between different types of snake predators.},

  Abstract = {Associations among organisms are thought to form because the benefits, such as increased foraging efficiency or decreased risk of predation, outweigh any costs, such as resource competition. Though many interspecific associations have been described for closely related mammals, few studies have examined the associations between mammals in different orders. The yellow mongoose (Cynictus pencillata), a carnivore, and the Cape ground squirrel (Xerus inauris), a rodent, co-occur in arid and semi-arid South Africa where they share sleeping burrows, predators, a similar body size, and the capability to emit alarm calls in response to predators. To investigate enhanced predator avoidance as a potential benefit explaining the persistence of this association, we assessed individual mongoose vigilance alone and with squirrels or other mongooses, and with varying interspecific group size, using field observations. We also tested for responses to conspecific and heterospecific alarm calls in both study species using playback experiments. The proportion of time mongoose individuals spent vigilant decreased in the presence of squirrels or other mongooses and was negatively correlated with interspecific group size; a similar pattern was previously shown for conspecific groups of Cape ground squirrels. These results are predicted by both the dilution and collective detection hypotheses. In addition, hetero- and conspecific alarm calls elicited vigilance responses in both species. These results suggest that both species can benefit from the collective detection and dilution arising from their interspecific association and that this interspecific association could be mutualistic.},

  Year = {2013},
  Abstract = {The black rat R. rattus and the Norway rat R. norvegicus are nocturnal rodents (Muridae), that originated in Asia but are now considered to be cosmopolitan because they can adapt to practically all types of environments. These species have been the object of many karyological studies that helped to establish a chromosomal polymorphism based on geographical distribution. For R. rattus, many geographical types have been described. An Asian type with a diploid number 2n = 42, that covers all of South and Southwest Asia, is considered to be the ancestral type. There is also a Japanese type with 2n = 42, a Sri-Lankan type with 2n = 40 located in West Asia, and an oceanic type with 2n = 38 that has spread through the rest of the world. For karyological study we followed the air-drying method. The chromosomes were observed with a NIKON H-III microscope under the 100x objective, after Giemsa staining was applied. Our karyological investigations of the genus Rattus carried out on 39 individuals of Rattus rattus and 15 of R. norvegicus. The karyotype of R. rattus shows a diploid number of 2n = 38 and a fundamental number of autosomes (NFa) varying from 58 to 60. It is interesting to note that only the oceanic type presents two large metacentric pairs of chromosomes, resulting from two successive Robertsonian fusions between the pairs 4-7 and the pairs 11-12. However, this chromosomal structure shows intra- and inter-populational variation. This karyotype reminds us of that defined in the Mediterranean, which corresponds to the oceanic type. It shows a supernumerary B chromosome with a frequency of 0.07 and the pair 13 has a variable morphology, probably due to a pericentric inversion, and gives the subtelocentric (ST) form with a frequency of 0.10. Otherwise, comparison of our results with those reported in the literature, particularly those for the Mediterranean, fit within the limits established for the oceanic type of R. rattus. On the contrary, in R. norvegicus the diploid number remains constant with 2n = 42 and a fundamental number of autosomes (NFa) of 62. These karyotypes are the same as those defined in North Africa and Europe. Finally, we suggest that our specimens of R. rattus and R. norvegicus show a close affinity with those identified in Europe.},

  Volume = {7},
  Year = {2013},
  Abstract = {The African pygmy mouse, Mus minutoides, is one of the very few mammal species that deviates from the classical mammalian XX/XY sex chromosome system by presenting a high proportion of fully fertile sex-reversed females. Since the still unknown sex reversal mutation is X-linked (X*), they are designated as X*Y females. Until now, X*Y females had only been identified in Southern Africa, but data were lacking for the rest of the vast sub-Saharan distribution range of this species. In this study, the PCR genotyping of the Y-linked Sry gene on 72 females from Western Africa (Guinea, Ivory Coast and Ghana) uncovered 10 sex-reversed females distributed in the 3 countries. This expands our understanding of the geographical distribution and temporal origin (dated at 0.9 mya) of the sex reversal mutation. In addition, we sequenced and analyzed a fragment of the Sry gene (including the complete high-mobility group, i.e. HMG box, and the partial C-terminal region). The results demonstrate the presence of multiple polymorphic copies of the gene as reported in other rodent species and reveal, more unexpectedly, an extremely high proportion of amino acid replacement within the HMG box. In effect, the predicted HMG box protein sequence similarity between some populations of M. minutoides is as low as 94.9\%, and at the interspecific level (within genus), it drops to only 91.1\% between M. minutoides and M. musculus.

  Year = {2013},
  Abstract = {Subfossil fecal pellets associated with Archaeolemur cf. edwardsi skeletal material from Anjohikely Cave in north-western Madagascar were probably derived from this large extinct lemur. Pellets were photographed, measured, and dissected. One of the pellets dates to 830 [plus or minus] 60 years BP. Pellets contain a wide variety of items indicative of omnivory, including fibrous fruit exocarps and seeds; bat, rodent, frog, and lizard bone; gastropod shell; and crustacean and arthropod exoskeletons - all within a matrix of comminuted vegetation. Pollen contents from inside intact pellets support other paleoecological evidence that recent feeding had taken place in wooded grassland habitat. This diet is consistent with ethnohistorical data and anatomical studies that indicate hard-object feeding in Archaeolemur. Archaeolemur may have deliberately entered caves to forage, although caves would also have offered water, abundant shade, cool conditions, cryptic sleeping sites, and refuge from predators. Cave-exploring behavior is rare in primates, but consistent with anatomical evidence that Archaeolemur was well adapted for terrestrial locomotion as well as arboreal climbing.},

  Abstract = {Our integrative approach combines two mitochondrial genes (16S and cyt b gene), two nuclear genes (exon 10 GHR and exon 1 IRBP) and craniometrical data to test the status and to infer phylogenetic relationships of the three Praomys Cameroon Volcanic Line endemics (P. hartwigi, P. morio and P. obscurus). The taxonomic rank of the principal genus group is assessed and the mode of diversification of species of the P. tullbergi complex in Afrotropical forests is discussed based on estimates of times to the most recent common ancestors and on tree topologies. This study documents for the first time the molecular and morphometrical distinctiveness of P. hartwigi and P. morio within the P. tullbergi species complex. Further studies including specimens of P. hartwigi from all its distribution range are needed to conclude on the status of P. obscurus. The monophyly of the genus Praomys is refuted. Times to the most recent common ancestors of major clades within the P. tullbergi species complex are estimated for the last 2.5 Mya and during the last 1 or 2 Mya for different species or forms. The lowland forest refuge hypothesis might well explain the diversification of P. misonnei, P. rostratus and P. tullbergi in the guineo-congolese forest block. The isolation of montane forests could have facilitated the divergence between the two montane forest forms P. hartwigi and P. obscurus and between populations of P. morio from the continent and those from the island of Bioko. Praomys populations (species) that inhabit the Cameroon Volcanic Line Praomys probably originated as lowland forms subsequently specialized to highland conditions.},

  Abstract = {We studied the phylogeographical structure of Praomys misonnei (Rodentia: Muridae) in west-Central Africa based on 113 individuals from 31 localities and the sequencing of two mitochondrial genes (Cytb and CO1). Two clades can be identified through maximum likelihood, bayesian and network analyses: the first one is limited to the Korup National Park, while the second one has a broad geographical distribution in west-Central Africa. The second clade can be further divided into three sub-clades. The results of neutrality tests and mismatch distributions indicate that a population expansion occurred in these sub-clades. During the middle or upper Pleistocene, the west-Central African populations of R misonnei may have been isolated in four different forest refugia, followed by population expansion and secondary contact during more humid periods. High genetic diversity was observed in the region of the Bakossi highlands, and the Cameroon Volcanic Line limits the geographical distribution of clades. Thus it seems likely that this volcanic line has in the past constituted a barrier that prevented the east west exchange between R misonnei populations through the expansion of the montane forest habitat. Our results also highlight the role of the Sanaga and Ogooue-Ivindo rivers in shaping R misonnei genetic structure.},

  Abstract = {The Mediterranean Basin is an acknowledged hotspot for biodiversity, yet historical processes that shaped this biodiversity in North Africa remain poorly understood. This study aimed to elucidate the phylogeographic pattern of an endemic species of Mediterranean areas of North Africa, the Greater Egyptian Jerboa, Jaculus orientalis. The extent of phylogeographic patterns and molecular genetic diversity (mitochondrial cytochrome b gene) were addressed in a survey of 45 jerboas from 24 localities. Our phylogeographical analyses show a strong genetic subdivision into three areas along a west-east axis, corresponding to (1) Morocco and western Algeria; (2) eastern Algeria, Tunisia and western Libya; (3) eastern Libya and Egypt. Demographic analyses revealed different modalities of population expansion since the last glacial age depending on geographic areas. The dating using relaxed molecular clock analyses revealed that most splits occurred during the Quaternary ({\textless}1 million of years ago). Finally, we discussed the relative roles of geological and climatic change in generating this pattern of genetic structure observed for the Greater Egyptian Jerboa and other vegetal and animal species in North Africa.},

  Volume = {41},
  Year = {2012},
  Abstract = {Gerbils of the genus Gerbillus represent an important part of small mammal diversity in arid regions of North Africa, but their taxonomy and evolutionary systematics and biogeography are still poorly known. Based on the recent collection of a series of gerbils in southern Morocco, including at the type localities of three endemic species, we gathered morphological, chromosomal and molecular data on a number of specimens that we compared with other available results. These data provide new insights into the geographical distribution of the endemic species known to date and suggest that an additional and previously undetected species may exist within this area. Multivariate analyses of morphometrical skull data validated the criteria used in the description of some of these species, while confirming the morphological similarity of a set of medium to large-sized species with hairy feet that can be considered sibling species. Karyotypes were useful for the specific assignation of a number of specimens. Molecular phylogenetics and divergence time estimates allow us to draw the first picture of the evolutionary relationships between endemic Gerbillus species from Morocco and related species of North Africa, and to estimate their respective timing of diversification. Most of the lineage emergence events took place during the Pleistocene, a period characterised by a global aridification of North Africa, but more importantly by important climatic and eustatic variations that may have played a role in species differentiation and subsequent expansion. This integrative approach proved to be essential in such species group including morphologically similar species. It also enables to propose testable hypotheses as to possible scenarios of emergence and evolution of these species along the western margin of the Sahara desert.},

  Abstract = {The Eastern Arc Mountains of southeastern Kenya and Tanzania hold a rich and unique biodiversity. The most celebrated of these mountains are the East and West Usambaras. Although these massifs have been the subjects of biological study for over a century, little is known about the shrews, bats, and rodents occurring in the montane forests. Using pitfall buckets, small mammal traps, and mist-nets, between 1991 and 1993, we surveyed the small mammals in the Amani area in the East Usambara and Ambangulu area in the West Usambara to document the natural history of the local fauna. These surveys were conducted during the dry season annually between early July and early September. In this chapter, we outline the study sites, methodologies, capture rates, and other trapping details. A total of 18,563 sample-nights was accrued over the three-year study, and on these two massifs, we documented 12 crocidurine shrew, one macroscelidid elephant shrew, 19 bat, and 14 rodent species. Species accumulation curves suggest that additional trapping effort may be required in the East Usambara Mountains to have a more complete view of the local small mammal fauna. There was no significant difference in the number of individuals captured or measures of species diversity in the pitfall and trap lines that were installed in the same location during the course of this study, suggesting that repeated sampling did not negatively affect the small mammal fauna of the study areas.},

  Abstract = {During three field seasons between 1991 and 1993, we carried out rodent inventories of the East and West Usambara Mountains, Tanzania. The general trapping protocol used involved both pitfall lines and trap lines (Sherman, Victor, and Museum Special traps), with a limited number of animals trapped within and outside of forest habitats by local people. A total of 885 individual rodents, representing 15 species, were collected during this study. For the East and West Usambara Mountains, 13 (12 native) and 12 (all native) rodent species were recorded, respectively. Most rodents were captured by trap lines (96.6\%); a few individuals were captured in the pitfall devices or brought to us by local people. The major exception is that all individuals of Dendromus (n = 11) obtained during the survey were in pitfall buckets. A total of 18,563 sample-nights were accrued over the three years, including 11,339 sample-nights (3314 pitfall-nights and 8025 trap-nights) in the East Usambara and 7224 sample-nights (1924 pitfall-nights and 5300 trap-nights) in the West Usambara Mountains. Based on species accumulation curves, no previously unrecorded species was trapped after 11,064 sample-nights in the East Usambara and after 5213 sample-nights in the West Usambara. However, a previously untrapped rodent (Graphiurus kelleni) was captured in the East Usambara on the third-to-last of 59 sampling days, suggesting that other non-canopy[long dash]restricted rodent species may have been missed during this survey. In a series of species accounts, information regarding the natural history of the different taxa handled during these surveys, including distribution, ecology, and condition of sexual organs, a list of referable specimens, and the trap devices that collected them, are presented. Trap and bucket lines combine to effectively sample most small- to medium-sized rodents. However, larger scansorial and canopy-restricted (squirrel) and fossorial (mole rat) species were not captured with our trapping methods, and these tabulations should not be considered a complete list of the small mammals of the Usambaras.},

  Abstract = {We studied the co-occurrence of flea species in infracommunities of 16 rodents from four regions (South Africa, Tanzania, central Europe and western Siberia) using null models, and predicted that flea co-occurrences will be expressed more strongly in male than in female hosts. We examined patterns of co-occurrence (measured as the C score) in infracommunities of fleas that are parasitic on male and female hosts by comparing co-occurrence frequencies with those expected by chance. When a significant degree of nonrandomness in flea co-occurrences was detected, it indicated aggregative infracommunity structure. In Tanzanian rodents, no significant flea co-occurrences were detected in either male or female hosts. In a South African rodent, significant flea co-occurrences were not detected in males, but were found in females in some localities. In Palaearctic rodents, significant nonrandomness was detected either equally for males and females or more frequently in males than in females. Meta-analyses demonstrated that the frequency of the detection of nonrandomness in flea co-occurrences was significantly higher in male than in female hosts. The values of the standardized effect size (SES) for the C score differed significantly among host species, but not between host genders. When the Palaearctic hosts were analyzed separately, the effects of both host gender and species appeared to be significant, with the SES values for the C score in males being smaller than those in females. The strength of the gender difference in the manifestation of flea community structure increased with increasing gender difference in flea species richness, and with decreasing gender difference in flea prevalence for the Palaearctic hosts. We conclude that male hosts are the main drivers of flea infracommunity structure. However, the manifestation of gender bias in flea community structure varies among host species, and is likely determined by the pattern of species-specific spatial behavior.},

  Abstract = {We studied the phylogeography of the strict savannah pygmy mice Mus (Nannomys) minutoides in West Central Africa. A total of 846 base pairs of the cytochrome b sequence were obtained for 66 individuals collected in Gabon, Cameroon, Republic of Congo and Central African Republic. These sequences were compared to those of M. minutoides from other African countries and to eight other species of the genus Mus. We performed maximum likelihood, Bayesian and nested clade analyses, as well as neutrality tests and time estimates. We show that M. minutoides is a well-differentiated monophyletic species that separated from other pygmy mice 1.17 Myr ago. A distinct West Central African M. minutoides clade diverged early from the other African populations of the species, with a more recent common ancestor dating 0.14 Myr. West Central African populations are globally homogeneous, despite the present fragmentation of savannahs by the rain forest. However, our analyses show an unexpected vicariance between geographically close savannahs, embedded in the rain forest in Central Gabon. One of these populations is genetically more similar to very distant peripheral populations than to three closely neighbouring populations situated on both sides of the Ogooue River. A non-river geographical barrier probably persisted in this area, durably isolating these local populations. This hypothesis about the history of the savannah landscape should be testable through the biogeographical analysis of other strict savannah small mammal species.},

Specimens include both modern samples extending from the beginning of last century to extant populations as well as archeological material. Several patterns in size variation were evidenced: i) there is a size gradient in molar teeth decreasing from North to South in modern mice, ii) a similar North-South gradient is present in archeological material indicating that it has existed at least since Gallo-Roman times, and iii) there is a decrease in size between the Gallo-Roman samples and modern ones. The geographical gradient was not gradual, but was characterized by a step cline on both sides of the 45th parallel, that is between the Mediterranean zone and the western European Continent. Within each of these compartments, no latitudinal variation from North to South was observed. The decrease in size of the house mouse since the Gallo-Roman period, or likely since the end of the Middle-Ages, could be due to landscape clearance and expansion of cereal-like cultivations. The commensal way of life, associated with an increase in population density, may have also had an effect.},

  Abstract = {Rodent diagnosis has long remained obscured by the co-existence of cryptic species in many lineages. However, alternative and accessible methods, such as cytotaxonomy and DNA-based methods, are now available that allow biologists to accurately monitor biodiversity through the production of well documented lists of unambiguously species-specific identifications. As a continuation of our previous surveys of West African rodents, we here present the first rodent inventory of rodents from Northern Cameroon (as well as one locality in Western Chad) that fully relies on karyotypic and/or sequencing data. Doing so, we assess the presence of 18 species in this poorly documented region. Among them, we found several African spiny mice that could be referred as to A. johannis, a poorly documented species. Moreover, several Arvicanthis individuals could be aggregated with previously studied but still enigmatic specimens of ANI-2 and ANI-4 sensu Volobouev etal. (2002a,b), thus suggesting that they may all belong to one single species, namely A. rufinus. In addition, one specimen was shown to belong to a new biological species (Praomys sp.) that will deserve further taxonomic investigations. Finally, several Taterillus specimens were found with 2n =28-30 chromosomes and a XX/XY1Y2 sex chromosome system. On the basis of these new results as well as a reinterpretation of previously published data, we propose to refer these individuals as to the poorly documented Taterillus lacustris. Altogether, our data suggest that Northern Cameroon is a "phylogeographical node" for several rodent lineages which may be at least partly explained by the past changes within the Lake Chad basin. Keeping this in mind, there is little doubt that biodiversity will undergo important modifications in the coming decades, following the increasing aridity and the drastic reduction of Lake Chad.

  Abstract = {Genus Meriones is the dominant member of gerbils in the Palaearctic region, particularly in aride region of Asia. This is also one of the most typical genus of subfamily Gerbillinae with about 17 morphospecies namely: M. persicus, M. hurrianae, M. zarudnyi M. vinogradovi, M. meridianus, M. libycus, M. crassus, M. tristrami, M. rex, M. tamariscinus, M. unguiculatus, M. shawi, M. grandis, M. sacramenti, M.dahli, M.chengi, M.arimalius . Of which first eight species have been recorded from the Iranian Plateau. There are minor differences between some species and hence, interspecific discrimination of specimens from each species is not always possible, even by polythetic methods using different taxonomic characters such as tympanic bullae, suprameatal triangle and external characters on material from museums and dental characters on archeozoological materials. Here, 26 morphological characters of 384 museum specimens belonging to 14 morphospecies of Meriones from North Africa, Iran and Central Asia were studied. This study review, 14 species of Meriones and based on the results, it seems that M.libycus, M. crassus and M. meridianus are complex species and need taxonomic revision. The cladistics analysis shows that M. vinogradovi could be forming ancestral species of genus Meriones, and west of Caspian Sea could be the center of origin for Meriones. Due to the presence of convergence regarding adaptation of different species of Meriones to similar environment, subgeneric morphological characters may cause homoplasies and paraphyletic subgenera the analysis of morphological character states matrix, using Mix program of Phylip shows different four clades that did not conform to the nominative subgenera and unveil probable homoplasy.},

  Abstract = {The Egyptian Government plan to move in 25 years from an inhabited area of 6-25\% of the total Nile land area to a larger one to compensate the huge increase of Egyptian populations. The decision was recently made to begin a development project at Toshka, on the western bank of the River Nile, Upper Egypt. Toshka depression is more or less close to Wadi Halfa of Sudan. Therefore, it was necessary to develop of Toshka on the west bank of the River Nile. Consequently, two specialized teams, one is national and the other is from WHO, were interested to study the health risk impact of the project on the vector-borne diseases and pests and to plan recommendations for prevention and feasible control of these diseases. The present study was initiated during spring of 2007 \& 2008, as spot light survey, on wild rodents and the arthropods having medical and/or veterinary importance. Whilst Psammomyes obesus Cretzchmar, 1828 was the only recognized rodent, the following arthropods were identified: the scorpion, Buthus quinquestriatus Hante en E., the insects, Cephus tabidus (F.), Ischnura senegalensis (Rambur, 1842), Mantis religiosa Linnaeus, 1758 and Tabanus taeniola Palisot de Beauvois, Culicoides riethi Kieffer, Anopheles sergenti Theobald and Phlebotomus papatasii (Scopoli). The medical, veterinary and agriculture importance of each species have been discussed and feasible control measures were suggested.},

  Abstract = {Home-range size may reflect the physiological state and energetic requirements of an individual. In the black-tailed tree rat (Thallomys nigricauda) we expected differences in the home-range size of populations in habitats of differing productivity, as measured along an aridity gradient, and between seasons. We studied the variations in home-range size of black-tailed tree rats by radiotracking in winter 2006, 2007 and summer 2007 at three study sites along an aridity gradient in southern Africa. Home ranges were estimated using 100\% and 95\% minimum convex polygons (MCP) and 95\% and 50\% fixed kernels. Home ranges varied widely, from 166 to 80 199 m2 for males and from 46 to 8810 m2 for females. Males had larger home ranges than females, which supports a promiscuous mating system reported for the species. Although range size was reduced in both sexes in winter, this was not significant. We found no significant difference in home-range size along the aridity gradient. It is suggested that a combination of habitat productivity, season and breeding system influences the size of home range and that this species displays phenotypic flexibility in terms of its behavioural responses to these factors.},

  Abstract = {Current understanding of the taxonomy and species relationships within the genus Eliurus, a member of the endemic Malagasy rodent subfamily Nesomyinae, is largely based on morphological characters. Little has been published about the historical biogeography and diversification factors in members of this genus. Here we examined, using molecular data, the evolutionary relationships, and species boundaries within a species complex of Eliurus and the role of rivers in their evolution. Specifically, we tested the hypothesized monophyly of E. antsingy (west) and the recently described E. carletoni (north) using two mitochondrial genes, cytochrome It, the control region, and a nuclear marker, the Interstitial Retinol Binding Protein (IRBP). We also assessed the species boundaries of E. carletoni and examined phylogeographic patterns using two mitochondrial markers and an extensive geographic sampling. Molecular data show that members of the E. antsingy and E. carletoni complex together form a monophyletic group. Although samples provisionally assigned to E. carletoni based on morphological characters from different sites in northern Madagascar cluster in three separate phylogroups, they are monophyletic and assignable to this species. Rivers do not act as strict barriers to dispersal in E. carletoni. The demonstrated monophyly of both E. antsingy and E. carletoni contributes to the amounting evidence for a biogeographic link between the north and western regions of the island.

  Abstract = {Since the mid-19th century, the Malagasy subfossil macrofauna has been the object of numerous studies and publications, contrary to the microfauna. New fieldwork, initiated in 2001, in the North West of Madagascar (Province of Mahajanga) led to the discovery of sites rich in fossiliferous breccias, containing micromammals. In this article, we describe two new subfossil species of rodent: Brachytarsomys mahajambaensis, the smallest within the genus and Nesomys narindaensis, the largest within the genus. Most of the extant species of these two genera live in the tropical rainforests of the eastern and north-eastern areas of Madagascar, far away from the north-western part of the island where a dry deciduous forest occurs. The presence of the two taxa in the subfossil record in the Northwest of the country suggests the occurrence of wetter conditions in the past in this region. (C) 2010 Academie des sciences.

  Abstract = {The genus Myosorex has a classic relict distribution within sub-Saharan Africa. Montane populations in eastern and western equatorial Africa are separated by ca. 2900 km. Until this study, the closest known populations in southern Africa were separated by nearly 2000 km from the closest populations in the Albertine Rift Valley. Here we document previously unknown populations of Myosorex, representing two new endemic taxa from montane forests adjacent to the Albertine Rift. In conjunction with additional data from Malawi, we fill in major gaps in our knowledge of the biodiversity and distribution of this genus in the areas of the Albertine and Malawi Rift Valleys. We demonstrate that this gap is an artefact of survey effort and collecting serendipity. The two new species described herein, as well as other species of Myosorex from north of the Zambezi River, exhibit limited distributions and are confined to montane habitats, typically above 1000 m. Our new species of Myosorex from Kahuzi-Biega NP (DRC) is the second known species of Myosorex from that park where it is syntopic with Myosorex babaulti. This is the first time that two species of Myosorex co-occur in any forest north of the Zambezi River. This suggests either sympatric speciation or a secondary re-invasion during times of climatic amelioration and forest expansion. The two species described here (Myosorex jejei and Myosorex bururiensis) are associated with two phenetically-defined species groups: the former with a more narrow hexagon-shaped skull, long-tail, and short claws ('narrow-headed group') and the latter with a more broad hexagon-shaped skull, short tail and long claws ('broad-headed group').},

  Volume = {154},
  Year = {2009},
  Abstract = {Mechanisms behind variation in physiological traits may assist in explaining how certain traits have evolved. The ability of mammals to concentrate urine has been seen as an adaptation to xeric environments. Urine osmolality and relative medullary thickness (RMT) are two indices which indicate urine concentrating powers. In addition, mammals living in xeric regions have lower water turnover rates (WTR) than their mesic counter-parts. The RMT, urine concentrating ability (UCA) and WTR of the Black-tailed Tree Rat, Thallomys nigricauda, were investigated at three study sites along an aridity gradient. We investigated the extent to which these traits are influenced by evolutionary adaptation and/or phenotypic flexibility. There was no significant difference in RMT between sites and no difference in osmolalities when site and season were taken into account In addition, there was no significant effect of site and season on WTR. This suggests that these traits might have a genetic basis, and reflect an evolutionary adaptation. Lack of differences in the renal traits in T. nigricauda across their range may be interpreted as lack of phenotypic flexibility. However, as a consequence of the degree of individual variation in the parameters measured there appears to be phenotypic flexibility with individuals responding to their specific conditions. This has positive implications for the survival of the species in the light of climate change. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract = {The zoonotic rat lung worm, Angiostrongylus cantonensis is endemic to Asia, North America, Africa and Australia. The parasite is expanding geographically and has recently been recorded in some of the Greater Antilles in the northern part of the Caribbean. In this study A. cantonensis is reported for the first time in the Lesser Antilles in one of the southernmost islands, Grenada. Between September 2005 and September 2006, 192 rats (Rattus norvegicus) were trapped throughout the island. The rats were anesthetized, exsanguinated, necropsied and the lungs were fixed whole in 10\% buffered formalin, trimmed, processed, cut at 3 [mu]m, stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined microscopically. A total of 45 (23.4\%) of the 192 rats examined were found to be infected with A. cantonensis and adult worms were found in the cardiopulmonary system of one of the rats. Microscopically, pulmonic lesions, consisting of pulmonary thrombosis, hypertrophy of pulmonary arteries and granulomatous pneumonia were associated with intralesional adults, larvae and embryonated eggs of A. cantonensis. An incidental finding of variably sized (2[long dash]7 mm) solitary to multiple cysts containing larvae of Taenia taeniaformis were seen in the livers of 57 rats. This report of A. cantonensis in Grenada provides evidence of the further global expansion of this important zoonotic parasite and the public health implications of this discovery is discussed.},

  Title = {A mammalian fauna from the {Late} {Oligocene} of northwestern {Kenya}.},
  Volume = {288},
  Year = {2009},
  Abstract = {Mammalian fossils have been collected over several decades by teams associated with the Kenya National Museums from two sites ill northwestern Kenya, Losodok and Benson's Site. Geological work in the area has determined that Losodok is Late Oligocene in age (BOSCHETTO et al. 1992); only one mammal from Losodok has been previously discussed in light of the age determinations, a catarrhine primate (LEAKEY et al. 1995). In this paper, we describe the rest of the mammals known from these sites, which proves to be a fauna consisting of at least 21 species in eight orders. Recent field work during the summer of 2007 yielded more mammals from both of these sites; additional mammal localities were found near Benson's Site, prompting us to designate the new region Nakwal. Several mammalian species are shared between the Losodok sample and that from Nakwal, indicating that they are about the same age. The mammallan faunas are distinctly Oligocene in their taxonomic composition, consisting of African groups previously known from the Early Tertiary such as hyracoids, arsinortheres, primitive proboscideans, thryonomyold rodents, proviverrine and pterodontine creodonts, catarrhine Primates, and anthracotheres. immigrant mammals characteristic of the African Early Miocene are conspicuously absent except for a small true carnivore of the genus Mioprionodon, the earliest fossil record of Carnivora in Africa. We formally describe two new genera (Losodokodon, a proboscidean, and Mlanyama, a creodont), and 8 new species (of the genera Brachyhyrax, Thyrohrax, Meroechyrax, Diamantomys, Mioprionodon, and the two new genera). Several other species are informally described and discussed but not named in this paper, and we also make new comparisons regarding Kamoyapithecus, the only species from Losodok previously named (LEAKEY et al. 1995). The new fauna is transitional between earlier Oligocene mammal faunas of Africa (known from Ethiopia, Egypt, and several other countries) and the Early Miocene faunas of East Africa. Several taxa are morphological intermediates, and potential phylogentic links, between early Tertiary forms and Miocene taxa; these include the proboscidean Losodokodon and the primate Kamoyapithecus. Others represent the earliest record for African groups otherwise known in the Miocene (Brachyhyrax, Afrohyrax, Meroehyrax, Prodeinotherium, Diamantomys). Still others represent the latest occurrence of taxa previously known from the Early Tertiary (pachyhyracinc hyracoids, Thyrohyrax, Arsinoitherium). All taxa in the fauna represent forms that could have evolved in situ in Africa except for the new species of Mioprionodon, which is an immigrant from the north. The new discoveries highlight the fact that the faunal transition between archaic endemic mammals of the Early Tertiary and the more modern Neogene faunas occurred during a very short time interval at or near the Oligocene-Miocene boundary. We discuss the nature and importance of this transition, which we designate the African Mid-Tertiary Event (AMTE).},

  Doi = {10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.11.004},
  Abstract = {As small arid-zone mammals, Cape ground squirrels (Xerus inauris) are unusual in being diurnally active. It is postulated that they remain active during the day by using their parasol-like tails to shade their bodies whilst foraging. However, no studies have continuously measured body temperature to determine the effect of using the tail as a parasol, relative to other thermoregulatory behaviours, such as burrow retreat. We caught four free-ranging Cape ground squirrels (673 [plus or minus] 36 g) and surgically implanted miniature temperature-sensitive data loggers into their abdomens, to record body temperature every 5 min to an accuracy of 0.04 [degree]C, before they were released back into their home range and observed for two weeks. Mean daily peak black globe temperature was 41 [degree]C, and daily peak body temperature reached 40 [degree]C. Ground squirrels raised their tails significantly more often at globe temperatures above 30 [degree]C, but raising the tail did not decrease body temperature, nor prevent body temperature rising. Ground squirrels retreated to burrows, at 18 [degree]C, significantly more often at high body temperatures and body temperature dropped 1-2 [degree]C before reemergence. We believe that the tail was raised to provide thermal comfort during high solar radiation exposure, and that burrow retreat was employed to dissipate a heat load and remain active diurnally.

  Abstract = {Hybridization and introgression can have important consequences for the evolution, ecology and epidemiology of pathogenic organisms. We examined the dynamics of hybridization between a trematode parasite of humans, Schistosoma mansoni, and its sister species, S. rodhaini, a rodent parasite, in a natural hybrid zone in western Kenya. Using microsatellite markers, rDNA and mtDNA, we showed that hybrids between the two species occur in nature, are fertile and produce viable offspring through backcrosses with S. mansoni. Averaged across collection sites, individuals of hybrid ancestry comprised 7.2\% of all schistosomes collected, which is a large proportion given that one of the parental species, S. rodhaini, comprised only 9.1\% of the specimens. No F1 individuals were collected and all hybrids represented backcrosses with S. mansoni that were of the first or successive generations. The direction of introgression appears highly asymmetric, causing unidirectional gene flow from the rodent parasite, S. rodhaini, to the human parasite, S. mansoni. Hybrid occurrence was seasonal and most hybrids were collected during the month of September over a 2-year period, a time when S. rodhaini was also abundant. We also examined the sex ratios and phenotypic differences between the hybrids and parental species, including the number of infective stages produced in the snail host and the time of day the infective stages emerge. No statistical differences were found in any of these characteristics, and most of the hybrids showed an emergence pattern similar to that of S. mansoni. One individual, however, showed a bimodal emergence pattern that was characteristic of both parental species. In conclusion, these species maintain their identity despite hybridization, although introgression may cause important alterations of the biology and epidemiology of schistosomiasis in this region.},

  Abstract = {We employed patch use theory to evaluate how several environmental factors influence the foraging behaviour of two rodent species: Grammomys dolichurus and Acomys cahirinus. Foraging efficiency was determined by measuring the remaining food in artificial food patches (giving-up densities: GUDs) from two experiments. in the first experiment, we placed patches in different microhabitat types (cover vs open) and at varying distances from cover. This experiment was conducted during three moon stages (waxing, full, waning). We found that the rodents had higher GUDs (lower foraging efficiency) in the open microhabitat. The distance from nearest shelter had a marginally significant positive effect on GUDs. GUDs were higher in both microhabitat types during the waxing and full phases, but decreased sharply once the moon began to rise after sunset. These results are likely due to higher predation risk away from cover and in more illuminated environments. In the second experiment, we examined mouse responses to seeds impregnated with plant toxins. Seeds impregnated with oxalic acid were avoided by the rodents, while seeds soaked in tannic acid did not differ significantly from control seeds. Our results highlight important ecological factors affecting the foraging behaviour of these rodents.},

  Abstract = {This contribution aimed to predict the invasive Barbary ground squirrel (Atlantoxerus getulus) potentiality for invading the Canary Islands and western Mediterranean region, by determining firstly the climatic suitable areas in its native range and secondly, using presence data in the invaded range. Nineteen environmental variables submitted to a Principal Components Analysis selected those variables with higher factor loadings, which represent the main environmental conditions of the Northern African region (temperature in the coldest quarter, seasonal temperature, precipitation in the coldest quarter, temperature in the wettest quarter). After selecting hundred times more pseudo-absence points than presence observations (n = 6600 at a 0.083[degree] resolution), Generalized Additive Models and Single-hidden-layer Neural Networks fitted in R were used to calibrate the model. Model results were extrapolated for the Canary Islands and the western Mediterranean region. In order to select between the two techniques, we calculated three accuracy measures (specificity, sensitivity and AUC) after using a Jack-knifing procedure and models were repeated ten times. The GAM model was less accurate than the NN model. Suitable areas did not have mean temperatures in the coldest quarter lower than -5[degree]C and precipitation in the coldest quarter higher than 300 mm, respectively. We predicted favorable climatic areas across almost all the Maghreb, the European western Mediterranean region and in all the Canary Islands. Nevertheless, the seven islands differed significantly in the mean favorability scores, with El Hierro, Lanzarote and Gran Canaria being the most suitable. Same methodological analysis was applied to predict A. getulus distribution in other Canarian islands based on presence data from the invaded Fuerteventura. In this case, only Lanzarote and Gran Canaria appeared to be climatically suitable for the species.

  Abstract = {Southward encroachment of the derived savanna zone with its attendant denudation of the rainforest in Nigeria adversely affects the diversity and distribution of mammals, particularly murid rodents. This study was carried out to establish the identities of murid rodent populations and to compare their diversity between forest and derived savanna sites within south western Nigeria. Identification of captured specimens was carried out by multivariate statistics of body and skull measurements, and also by analysis of certain discrete characters. Six species were identified: Praomys tullbergi, Hylomyscus stella, Mastomys natalensis, Arvicanthis rufinus, Lemniscomys striatus and Lophuromys sikapusi. Forest sites possessed a higher Shannon's diversity index (1.685) than the derived savanna sites (0.978), containing a higher number of taxa and larger abundance of murid rodents. This underscores the negative impact that encroachment of the derived savanna has upon diversity of animals in areas that were once forest.},

  Abstract = {Meriones shawi burrows in the hard clay of Western Mediterranean coastal desert, particularly beneath the shrubs of Anabasis articulata and Lycium sp., where its burrows may be mistaken for those of Psammomys obesus and vice versa. The present work aims to determine the degree of morphological as well as craniometrical differences between Psammomys obesus and Meriones shawi, to study their genetic variations and to define the confidential relationship between them. In the present study, nine character ratios were calculated from both the morphometric and cranial measurements. The comparisons between the two species by t-test showed highly significant changes in all the ratios except for hind foot length/head and body length (HFL/HBL) and nasal length/occipitonasal length (NL/ONL) which showed non-significant change. The allelic frequencies indicated that some alleles were restricted to the species studied and can be used as a marker for them. Psammomys obesus showed polymorphism in 0.9\% of the studied loci with a mean number of alleles per locus A = 2.73. Meriones shawi was polymorphic in all studied loci with a mean number of alleles of 2.82 per locus. The samples from Psammomys obesus and Meriones showed homozygous excess in eight loci. The genetic distance between Psammomys obesus and Meriones shawi was found to be 0.152 (i.e. the genetic similarity is 0.848).},

  Abstract = {In grassland systems across the globe, ecologists have been attempting to understand the complex role of fire, grazing and rainfall in creating habitat heterogeneity and the consequences of anthropogenic control of these factors on ecosystem integrity and functioning. Using a South African grassland ecosystem as a model, we investigated the impact of fire and grazing pressure on small mammal communities during three differing periods of a rainfall cycle. Over 2 years, 15,203 trap nights revealed 1598 captures of 11 species (nine rodents, one macroscelid and one insectivore). Results highlighted the importance of the interplay between factors and showed that the role of fire, grazing and rainfall in determining small mammal abundance was species-dependant. While no two species were affected by the same environmental variables, grass cover or height was important to 56\% of species. Considered independently, high rainfall had a positive influence on small mammal abundance and diversity, although the lag period in population response was species-specific. High grazing negatively affected overall abundance, but specifically in Mastomys coucha; fire alone had little immediate impact on small mammal diversity. Six months after the fire, vegetation cover had recovered to similar levels as unburned areas, although small mammal diversity and richness were higher in burned areas than unburned areas. Grazing levels influenced the rate of vegetation recovery. In conclusion, low-level grazing and burning can help to maintain small mammal biodiversity, if conducted under appropriate rainfall levels. A too high grazing pressure, combined with fire, and/or fire conducted under drought conditions can have a negative impact on small mammal biodiversity. To maintain small mammal diversity in grassland ecosystems, the combined effects of the previous year's rainfall and existing population level as well as the inhibition of vegetation recovery via grazing pressure need to be taken into consideration before fire management is applied.},

  Abstract = {The Cape ground squirrel Xerus inauris is unusual among social mammals as it exhibits a low reproductive skew, being a facultative plural breeder with not all females breeding within a group. We investigated pituitary function to assess whether there was reproductive inhibition at the level of the pituitary and potentially the hypothalamus in breeding and non-breeding female Cape ground squirrels. We did so during the summer and winter periods by measuring luteinizing hormone (LH) responses to single doses of 2g exogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and physiological saline administered to 42 females from II colonies. Basal LH concentrations of females increased in response to the GnRH challenge. Basal plasma LH concentrations were greater during winter, when most oestrus events are observed. However, we found no differences in plasma LH concentrations between breeding and non-breeding females. We showed that the anterior pituitary of non-breeding female ground squirrels is no less sensitive to exogenously administered GnRH than that of breeding females. We therefore concluded that the pituitary is no more active in breeding than non-breeding females. The lack of differentiation in response to GnRH suggests that either non-breeding females have ovaries that are less sensitive to LH or that they refrain from sexual activity with males through an alternative mechanism of self-restraint.},

  Abstract = {Our earlier chromosome banding studies of Acomys cahirinus and Acomys dimidiatus (the latter long considered to be a subspecies of the former) revealed that, despite very close diploid numbers (36 vs. 38), these taxa possess sharply different karyotypes and undoubtedly belong to different species. In this context, the taxonomic status and the relationship between the two chromosomal forms in Sinai (2n = 36) and Israel (2n = 38), chromosomally homozygous across a vast range except for a very narrow hybrid zone, remain poorly documented. Neither of these forms have previously been studied by chromosome banding; thus, the exact nature of chromosomal differences as well as the species to which these forms should be assigned remain unknown. Here, we present the data on comparative G-banding analysis and morphometrics of Acomys from Israel, Sinai, and Saudi Arabia, and a hybrid obtained in laboratory crosses between latter two. The analysis revealed that karyotype of Acomys from Israel is identical to that of Acomys from Saudi Arabia and both are different from that of Acomys from Sinai by one Robertsonian fusion. Therefore, karyotypically, all three are very different from A. cahirinus. It follows from the study that Sinai and probably Arabian peninsula and Minor Asia must be excluded from geographical distribution of A. cahirinus, which is limited from West Sahara to Egypt along Nile river (except Sinai). Furthermore, the synthesis of chromosomal and recent molecular data suggests a phylogeographical scenario explaining the modern distribution of Acomys in the Sinai and Arabian peninsulas and permits the update of the taxonomic status of these populations.

  Abstract = {One way to avoid potential predators is to be sensitive to odour cues, particularly those in faeces and urine, left by predators. This sensitivity has been demonstrated in many solitary, nocturnal, small mammals which may fall victim to ambush predators. We tested the response of Cape ground squirrels, a diurnal, group-living small mammal, to the presence of predator (black-backed jackal) faeces and non-predator (black wildebeest) dung in baited traps, and also predator faeces and non-predator dung outside their burrows. The squirrels showed a significantly higher avoidance of traps scented with predator faeces than both control and non-predator dung-scented traps. They also took significantly longer to emerge from burrows that had predator faeces outside compared with control burrows and burrows with non-predator dung outside and showed a trend for higher vigilance once they emerged from burrows with predator faeces outside. We argue that as diurnal group-living reduces a reliance on olfactory cues, this species is more likely to rely on visual cues and the vigilance of other individuals than nocturnal solitary species that have been the focus of most studies up till now. As a result, squirrels very quickly return to normal behaviour after exposure to a predator cue. Level of sociality is likely to influence responses to olfactory cues of predators and should be the focus of further studies.},

  Year = {2007},
  Abstract = {The genus Arvicanthis Lesson, 1842 (Rodentia; Muridae; Murinae) comprises herbivorous unstriped grass rats widespread in the Nile Valley and West, Central and East Africa. Two species (A. niloticus and A. testicularis) have previously been reported to occur in the Nile Valley but with many taxonomic uncertainties. This investigation was aimed at clarifying the systematic position of these two putative species in Sudan by using cytogenetic data and random amplification of polymorphic DNA (PCR-RAPDs) fragments. Karyological comparisons of the two putative species, captured in six different regions of Sudan, revealed the existence of one species, A. niloticus, with a diploid number of 2n = 62 and N.F.A = 62, identical to karyotyped populations from northeastern Africa (Egypt and Ethiopia), which belong to the known cytotype ANI-1a. The PCR-RAPD protocol used in this study was shown to be consistent, reproducible and highly informative. Analysis of the genetic profiles of samples showed no separation of Arvicanthis individuals into "species" or populations (divergence range = 0.05 - 0.19\%). Furthermore, t-tests revealed that intra-population divergences were significantly higher than inter-population values (two-tailed t-test for unequal variances; 0.001 {\textless} P {\textless} 0.05), indicating that genetic variation is not structured geographically. The data obtained from the two systematic methods suggest the absence of reproductive isolation and it therefore appears more appropriate to consider Arvicanthis from Sudan to represent a single species, namely A. niloticus.},

  Title = {Population dynamics, habitat choice, and breeding range of collared flycatcher {Ficedula} albicollis are determined by edible dormouse {Glis} glis.},
  Volume = {21},
  Year = {2007},
  Abstract = {In the 19th, and at the beginning of the 20th century, Collared Flycatchers Ficedula albicollis Were probably always sparsely distributed in SW Germany. In the state and communal forests of Baden-Wuerttemberg, the rise in the number of nest boxes from 0 to over 200.000 in the 25 years after 1950 triggered an enormous population increase to about 5.000-7.000 breeding pairs. A slight rise in numbers had already been recorded obviously due to the high numbers of cold winters in the period 1930-1971. since the resulting decline in competing species benefited the Collared Flycatcher. With stagnation in the number of boxes the population began to decline. The population increase in meadow orchards was similar and was perhaps influenced by the high population increase in woodland. But while there was only a temporary drop in the meadow orchard population due to climatic factors in Africa (Sahel drought) in 1970-1990, the forest population has almost disappeared. The factors suggested as possible causes of the population fall since ca. 1975 included an "Atlanticisation" of the breeding season climate in Central Europe, the effects of toxic substances used in forests and meadow orchards, the grubbing up of fruit trees, or the loss of mature forest stands. None of these factors appears to have played a decisive role in the drop in numbers. Although mature tree stands, and therefore natural cavities, have increased over the last 50 years, the flycatcher nearly disappeared from woodland. However the ca. 5 million nest box records from the forests of Baden-Wurttemberg highlight a phenomenon that until now has been almost ignored. This population decrease in woodland has, for over 20 years, run counter to the increase in the numbers of the Edible Dormouse Glis glis. Around 1950, this species occupied between 2 and 7 \% of nest boxes: today that figure is 20-30 \%, but regionally can be well above 70 \%. During the first 25 years of nest box monitoring, Edible Dormice found in nest boxes were killed. While this dormouse's active period hardly overlaps with the breeding season of tits Parus spp. and Nuthatch Sitta europaea, it clashes completely with that of the flycatcher. Through competition for nest boxes and predation on birds. both young and adults, it has become the dominant factor. Following an "Edible Dormouse year" there are Ficedula albicollis population declines in the two subsequent years. leading in the medium-term to elimination of subpopulations and a reduction in breeding range. Declining interest in the hunting of Red Foxes Vulpes vulpes, plus oral vaccination against rabies, have led to a huge rise in the fox population. In forests this has meant a reduction in the numbers of martens Martes spp., even though they are also hunted less, which in turn has profited the Edible Dormouse. Now increasing numbers of competitors in the forests are diminishing the supply of cavities. Of all successful breeding attempts by birds, the percentage represented by Collared Flycatcher in the forests of SW Germany fell from regional values of 3-30 \% to present-day levels that can barely be measured. Only a local trial since 1999 to encourage flycatchers in the forests by preventing the settlement and reproduction of Edible Dormouse has resulted in a strong improvement in Ficedula albicollis numbers, and its share of all successful birds breeding in nest boxes rose (despite unfavourable climatic developments at 700 m a.s.l.) from an average of below 2 \% to 33 \%. The almost complete exclusion of a single competitor/predator has therefore led to a substantial in-crease in the Collared Flycatcher population. The Edible Dormouse, which is uncommon away from woodland, is almost certainly the chief cause for the disappearance of Collared Flycatchers from SW-German forests, which, with their increasingly semi natural management regime and their rising mast crop, are proving to be an ecological trap for the species. Also their preference for alluvial woodland might be explained by the fact that dormice that hibernate underground are drowned. So what can be singled-out here over the past 70 years is that the weight given to the dominant factors affecting Collared Flycatcher numbers at different times has frequently altered: Periods with an above average number of cold winters decimated competing cavity-breeders like tits and Nuthatch between 1930 and 1970. From 1950 to 1970 the erection of a huge number of nest boxes and the killing of Edible Dormice resulted in Collared Flycatcher being a common woodland bird species. Simultaneously, toxic substances in the environment have apparently affected predators (Sparrow hawk Accipiter nisus) and cavity-competitors (wasps, hornets, bats; Vespidae, Chiroptera) more than the flycatcher, and hence it has even becoming re-established in woodlands. Studies confirm this (Tab. 2), but also show that the former high numbers of this flycatcher were artificially maintained. The strong recovery trend in flycatcher numbers since the 1990s were only seen in the meadow orchards. where the species profited from the decline of its cavity-competitors Tree Spar-row Passer montanus and Starling Sturnus vulgaris and the absence of Edible Dormice.},

  Abstract = {Rodent species abundance and diversity in Western Serengeti are evaluated and discussed in relation to different levels of conservation status (Unprotected Area (UA), Game Reserve (GR) and National Park (NP)) and broad site differences in human livelihood activities. A total of 2170 individuals, spread over 16 rodent species, were caught in a capture-mark-recapture study which covered both the dry and wet seasons. The more humid site (Tabora B) in the northern part of Serengeti had the highest diversity of rodents followed by the Mihale site at the western extension. The driest site at Robanda had the lowest overall species diversity. Diversity also varied between the three levels of conservation status whereby the UA had the least diversity while the NP, which enjoyed the highest level of conservation status, had the highest diversity of rodents. Unprotected Area and NP plots at Tabora B showed a rodent species similarity index of 40\%; all the other paired plots scored over 50\% similarity indices, suggesting that, within a site, species composition did not vary significantly between the three levels of conservation status. The Robanda site had the highest (56\%) overall abundance of rodents; Mihale and Tabora B sites had about the same level of rodent abundance (20 and 24\% respectively). For the Mihale site, Mastomys natalensis ranked first followed by Arvicanthis niloticus and Tatera robusta, each of which contained 40, 38 and 16\%, respectively, of all individuals caught at the site. For the Robanda site, the figures were 66\%A. niloticus, 22\%M. natalensis and 9\%T. robusta; while for the Tabora B site the scores were 37\%M. natalensis, 18\%T. robusta and 11\%Lemniscomys barbarus. The differences in diversity, species composition and population abundance appear to result largely from physiognomic vegetation types, and habitat perturbations caused by livelihood activities in Western Serengeti.},

  Abstract = {This paper investigates the usefulness of two mitochondrial genes (16S rRNA and cytochrome b) to solve taxonomical difficulties within the genus Hylomyscus and to infer its evolutionary history. Both genes proved to be suitable molecular markers for diagnosis of B Hylomyscus species. Nevertheless the resolving powers of these two genes differ, and with both markers (either analyzed singly or in combination), some nodes remain unresolved. This is probably related to the fact that the species emerged during a rapid diversification event that occurred 2-6 Myr ago (4-5 Myr ago for most divergence events). Our molecular data support the recognition of an "aeta" group, while the "alleni'" and "parvus" groups are not fully supported. Based on tree topology and genetic divergence, two taxa generally recognized as subspecies should be elevated at the species level (H. simus and H. cf kaimosae). H. stella populations exhibit ancient haplotype segregation that may represent currently unrecognized allopatric species. The existence of cryptic species within H. parvus is questioned. Finally, three potentially new species may occur in West Central Africa. The Congo and Oubangui Rivers, as well as the Volta and Niger Rivers and/or the Dahomey gap could have formed effective barriers to Hylomyseus species dispersal, favoring their speciation in allopatry. The pronounced shifts in African climate during the late Pliocene and Miocene, which resulted in major changes in the distribution and composition of the vegetation, could have promoted speciation within the genus (refuge theory). Future reports should focus on the geographic distribution of Hylomyscus species in order to get a better understanding of the evolutionary history of the genus. [copyright] 2005 Elsevier Inc.

  Abstract = {The porcupine (Hystrix cristata) is a typical species of northern Africa while in Europe it is only present in the Italian peninsula. Since the mid eighties of the last century the distribution of this species, classically identified in the center-south of Italy and in Sicily, has been in rapid expansion northwards and it now occupies completely new territories. It is presently distributed in a more or less homogeneous manner along the Po Basin side of the Apennines, in the provinces of Modena, Parma, Rimini and Reggio Emilia. It has recently been observed north of the Po River in Lombardy and the Veneto area and towards the west in Liguria and Piedmont. The present study gives an updated view of the presence of this species in the Veneto area, above all in light of the most recent observations which represent the most northern records of the porcupine in Italy.},

  Year = {2006},
  Abstract = {The palaeontological site of Hoedjiespunt 1 (HDPI) has been dated to the late Middle Pleistocene. The rich mammalian fauna, recovered from the site, including four hominid teeth, is believed to have been accumulated by a hyaena. Micromammals were recovered from within the same horizons as the macro fauna. Previous analyses of the micromammals from the hyaena lair did not include a taphonomic analysis, and the agent of accumulation was assumed to be the hyaena responsible for the accumulation of the larger mammals. This assumption had not, however; been verified by a taphonomic analysis of the micromammal assemblages. A taxonomic and taphonomic study was thus carried out on the HDPI micromammals in order to identify the predator(s) or agents responsible for the micromammal accumulation, and to evaluate the suitability of the assemblage for palacoenvironmental analysis. The general pattern of species distribution of the murids from the two main fossil-bearing horizons at Hoedjiespunt I suggests that the micromammals have come from the same, original assemblage. The similarity observed in the micromammal taxonomy of these horizons is echoed in the taphonomy. The digestion on prey incisors, together with the range and activity patterns of prey species, suggests that the predator responsible for the fossil accumulation was a barn owl. The assemblage may provide a brief window into the micromammal population living on the west coast, in the immediate vicinity of the site, during the late Middle Pleistocene.},

  Abstract = {The rupicolous noki or dassie-rat (Petromus typicus) is endemic to the south-west arid biogeographical region of Africa. Nokis are diurnal and, compared to nocturnal small mammals, are relatively easy to observe, yet few field studies have been completed. Using radio-tracking and direct observation, a population of nokis in Namibia was intermittently studied over 3 years to document their basic natural history. Temperature loggers and temperature-sensitive radio tags were used to determine that nokis do not have a labile body temperature and do not go into daily torpor. They spend nights deep in rock crevices, but seemingly do not build or use nests. During the cool winter months they bask in the sun at sunrise, and during the heat of the day they shelter in cool rock crevices. During the warm part of the year they bask less frequently. Because nokis have a low relative metabolic rate and a diet of seasonally poor-quality forage, their frequent use of solar basking and passive heat gain and loss from the massive rocks in their habitat is probably related to conservation of energy.},

A hundred and eighteen species belonging to 10 orders were identified. Over 2,000 biological specimens were virologically and serologically examined. Six arboviruses were isolated. These included Dugbe virus (from the hussar monkey Cercopithecus (Erythrocebus patas) and 5 viruses from chiropters: Rift valley fever, from Micropteropus pusillus, Miniopterus schreibersi, and Hipposideros caffer, Saboya, Fomede, and Ank 6909 from Nycteris gambiensis and Kolenter from Hipposideros sp. Fomede, Kolente, and Ank 6909 viruses turned Out to be new species for science. Rodents were found to have viral antigens of Lass fever (Mastomys natalensis, Tatera valida kempi and Rattus rattus), Dugbe and Chikungunya fevers (M.natalensis) and West Nile fever (Mus sp.). A serological survey of mammals revealed that the latter had antibodies to 12 arboviruses.

  Volume = {5},
  Year = {2005},
  Abstract = {A description is given of Psittacobrosus bechsteini n. sp. (Menoponidae sensu lato) from a female individual removed from a skin of the Cuban Macaw Ara tricolor, a Cuban endemic extinct since the 19th century. This find provided an opportunity to recall the relationship between ornithology and parasitology established by JOHANN MATTHAEUS BECHSTEIN (1757-1822) at the end of the 18th century. With regard to the listing of (4) scientific animal names created in honour of J. M. BECHSTEIN, it is argued here why the name of the small lepidopteran (Bucculatricidae). 'Bucculatrix bechsteinella (BECHSTEIN \& SCHARFENBERG, 1805)' should be revised as Bucculatrix bechsteinella (SCHARFENBERG in BECHSTEIN \& SCHARFENBERG, 1805). An annotated list identifies the animal louse species regarded as definitely or probably extinct up to the present day, as well as their hosts. It has been claimed that six fossil finds that are dealt with here are all animal lice. in actual fact, this applies to the following three records only: 1. Imagines of Neohaematopinus relictus DUBININ, 1948 (Anoplura, Polyplacidae) ex Spermolegus (Urocitellus) glacialis (VINOGRADOV) (Rodentia, Sciuridae), Pleistocene (ca. 10 000 years old), Yakutskaya. 2. Several eggs of an unknown animal louse (Anoplura ?) on hairs probably from a sciurid-like rodent (Rodentia), Baltic amber, Eocene (ca. 40 million years old), Germany. 3. An imago of Megamenopon rasnitsyni WAPPLER, SMITH \& DALGLEISH, 2003 (Amblycera, Menoponidae sensu lato) perhaps from a procellariiform, charadriiform or anseriform bird. Eocene (40 million years old), Germany. The Cretaceous Saurodectes vrsanskyi RASNITSYN \& ZHERIKHIN, 1999, a presumed ectoparasite on hair-covered pterosaurs, did not belong to the Phthiraptera but to another insect order. Recent (probably) extinct animal lice from mammals are apparently as yet unknown, but in contrast, apart from Psittacobrosus bechsteini n. sp., the following 11 species are known that once parasitized birds. In order of their first description they are: 1. Acutifrons caracarensis (KELLOGG \& MANN, 1912) (lschnocera, Philopteridae s.l.) ex Caracara lutosa (RIDGWAY) (Falconidae). Guadalupe Island (Mexico). 2. Longimenopon dominicanum (KELLOGG \& MANN, 1912) (Amblycera. Menoponidae s.l.) ex Oceanodroma macrodactyla W. E. BRYANT (Hydrobatidae), Guadalupe Island. 3.

Nitzschiella hemiphagae TENDEIRO, 1972 (Ischnocera, Goniodidae) ex Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae spadicea (LATHAM) (Columbidae), Norfolk Island (New Zealand). 9. Patellinirmus restinctus TENDEIRO, 1972 (Ischnocera, Goniodidae) ex Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae spadicea (LATHAM) (Columbidae), Norfolk Island. 10. Huiacola extinctus MEY, 1990 (Ischnocera, Philopteridae s.I.) ex Heteralocha acutirostris (GOULD) (Callaeatidae). New Zealand (North Island). 11. Philopteroides xenicus MEY, 2004 (Ischnocera. Philopteridae s.l.) ex Xenicus l. longipes (J. F. GMELIN) (Acanthisittidae), New Zealand. Further unnamed forms await their description, or their discovery on hosts that have become extinct during the last 400 years. Historical animal louse records are known from: 1. Trimenopon hispidum (BURMEISTER, 1838) (Amblycera, Trimenoponidae), 2. Gliricola porcelli (SCHRANK, 1781) (Amblycera, Gliricolidae), both ex Cavia porcellus f. dom.

  Doi = {10.1007/s00265-005-0909-7},
  Abstract = {A growing number of studies indicate that females can increase the viability of their offspring by gaining direct benefits such as parental care or genetic advantages through selective mating with certain males. Among the best candidates for the genetic basis of mate choice in vertebrates are the genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) because these highly polymorphic genes may increase offspring viability and provide direct cues for mate choice. A free-ranging, pair-living rodent was used as an example to investigate MHC-dependent mate choice in an obligate monogamous species, the Malagasy giant jumping rat Hypogeomys antimena. Two possible mechanisms of mate choice were tested. First, mate choice may occur to increase the heterozygosity of MHC genes in the progeny and, second, mates might choose each other according to the degree of dissimilarity of their functional MHC DRB (exon 2) proteins in order to maximise the allelic divergence in their offspring. Analyses of 65 Hypogeomys couples failed to confirm associations of mating patterns with the MHC genotype to increase heterozygosity or MHC allelic divergence in the progeny. Also, no evidence for mechanisms to increase the allelic divergence was found in sex-specific analyses where a male or female, respectively, migrated to and was accepted by a territory and burrow holder of the opposite sex. However, the frequency distribution of 0, 1 or 2 new alleles potentially available for the progeny differed significantly when a new male was chosen by a territory-holding female. In contrast to current models, genetically similar instead of dissimilar mates seem to be the preferred choice. This is the first study investigating the role of the MHC in mate selection in an obligate monogamous rodent.},

  Abstract = {The history of Western Cape mammalogy began almost 200 years ago with Thunberg ( 1811) and has been augmented periodically ever since. The present paper follows Vernon ( 1972) and Grindley et al. ( 1973) in eliciting information from material in Barn owl Tyto alba (Scopoli) pellets. Analyses are based on identified and counted mandibles and maxillae. The Laminate vlei rat, Otomys laminatus Thomas and Schwann, and Krebs's fat mouse, Steatomys krebsii Peters, are shown to have wider distributions than were previously recorded. The Southern multimammate mouse, Mastomys coucha ( A. Smith), is apparently expanding its range westwards, a move probably enabled by changes in vegetation due to farming practices. There appears to be some correspondence between proportional representation of some species and rainfall, either its amount per annum or its seasonality. Variation in alveolar length in Cape gerbils, Tatera afra ( Gray), taken as a proxy for mean individual mass, suggests that mean size in this species may be influenced by rainfall seasonality. Although the Vlei rat, Otomys irroratus (Brants), is known to breed throughout the year, the present evidence indicates that in the West Coast National Park births peak in late spring and early summer, some two months after maximum rainfall. The Western Cape data support the concept that T. alba is a selective opportunist. Sample structure and co-occurrence of species in individual pellets both show that in some cases the owls are more nearly opportunistic while in others they appear to be considerably more selective.},

  Abstract = {In a sleeping sickness focus of Cote d'Ivoire, trypanosomes were characterized in humans, pigs and tsetse using various techniques. Out of 74 patients, all the 43 stocks isolated by KIVI (Kit for In Vitro Isolation) appeared to belong to only one zymodeme of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense group 1 (the major zymodeme Z3). The only stock isolated on rodents belonged to a different, new, zymodeme (Z50), of T. b. gambiense group 1. From 18 pigs sampled in the same locations as the patients, PCR showed a high proportion of mixed infections of T. brucei s. l. and T. congolense riverine-forest. Zymodemes of T. brucei s. l. from these pigs were different from those found in humans. From a total of 16 260 captured tsetse (Glossina palpalis palpalis), 1701 were dissected and 28\%, were found to be infected by trypanosomes. The most prevalent trypanosome was T. congolense riverine-forest type, followed by T. Vivax, T. brucei s. l. and T. congolense savannah type, this latter being associated to the forest type of T. congolense in most cases. Mixed infections by 2 or 3 of these trypanosomes were also found. Use of a microsatellite marker allowed us to distinguish T. b. gambiense group I in some of the mature infections in tsetse. Differences in infection rates and in trypanosome genotypes according to the host might indicate that the pig malt not be an active animal reservoir for humans in this focus.},

  Abstract = {Aim We investigated the patterns of body-size changes of the north-western Mediterranean Plio-Pleistocene large mammal faunas (excluding rodents, bats, lagomorphs and insectivores) in order to identify the tempo and mode of the major shifts in body size distribution, and to put them in the context of Plio-Pleistocene environmental changes and the development of the Mediterranean climate. Location. We analysed fossil faunas of Spain, France and Italy. A set of recent regional faunas from several macroclimatic regions was selected to serve as elements for comparison of the size distribution of past faunas, consisting of: Spain, France and Italy together, Florida, California, Central Chile, Indochina, India, Korea-Manchuria, Malawi, The Cape, North Africa, Turkey and Australia. Methods. Mammal species were grouped into five body size categories for carnivores and four categories for noncarnivore species. The number of species in each size category was computed and the resulting matrix of body weight classes X regions and time intervals was used as an input matrix in a Correspondence Analysis. Results. Recent and fossil faunas strongly differ in body size structure. The distribution of recent faunas within the CA seems to reflect both ecological and historic factors, intertwined in a complex fashion. No clear relationship has been observed between body size structure and environmental factors. During the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene there were only minor changes in the pattern of size distribution, although plant communities were in a transition process from subtropical forests to Mediterranean woodlands and steppes. The major change in body size structure of the north-western Mediterranean fauna occurred at the Galerian, around 1 Ma ago. This marked the beginning of the modern fauna, and a general trend towards a larger body size, reduction in the number of medium sized herbivores, and an increase of large herbivores and megaherbivores. Main conclusions. The Plio-Pleistocene faunas lack modern analogues. The body size structure of mammalian regional faunas appears to be strongly dependent on historical factors. The only major shift in body size distribution occurred during the Plio-Pleistocene, in the late Villaftanchian-Galerian transition, coincident with the onset of the Pleistocene high intensity glacial cycles.},

  Abstract = {The African pygmy mice, subgenus Nannomys, constitute the most speciose lineage of the genus Mus with 19 recognized species. Although morphologically very similar, they exhibit considerable chromosomal diversity which is here confirmed and extended by the G-banding analysis of 65 mice from West and South Africa. On the basis of their karyotype and distribution area, the specimens were assigned to at least five species. Extensive differentiation both within and between species was observed that involved almost exclusively Robertsonian translocations, 23 of which are newly described. Two of the rearrangements were sex chromosome-autosome translocations, associated in some cases with partial deletions of the X or Y chromosomes. Several authors have predicted that the highly deleterious effect of this rearrangement would be reduced if the sex and autosomal segments were insulated by a block of centromeric heterochromatin. The C-banding analyses performed showed that among the species carrying X-autosome translocations, one followed the expected pattern, while the other did not. In this case, functional isolation of the sex and autosome compartments must involve other repetitive sequences or genomic traits that require further molecular characterization. Such studies will provide insight into the causes and consequences of the high diversity of sex chromosome rearrangements in this subgenus.},

Results were characteristic of montane semi-evergreen rain forest with higher levels of small mammal biomass at the lower elevation suggesting increased forest productivity due to an abundance of water, high plant and microhabitat diversity, and in core areas, relatively low levels of disturbance. Local hunters and guides confirmed the presence of the endemic Nimba otter shrew (Micropotamogale lamottei) based on pictures and descriptions of based on pictures and descriptions of lamottei the animal, but this species could not be observed or captured during the RAP.},

  Abstract = {The composition, structure, and reproductive phenology of a community of murid rodents were investigated for 1 year at two sites in an undisturbed forest in southwestern Gabon, Africa. We captured 1531 mice belonging to 11 species and eight genera. At both sites, species richness varied seasonally and tended to be maximal during the period of maximal trap success. For the most abundant species (Hylomyscus stella, Hybomys univittatus, Heimyscus fumosus, and Praomys cf. misonnei), a general unimodal trend in trap success was detected, owing to variations in breeding activity and survival, with a minimum around the long rainy season and a maximum either during the short rainy season or at the beginning of the following long dry season. These fluctuations varied in magnitude among species, and seasonal variations in relative abundance were recorded. Our results support the assumption that in the tropics, rainfall and associated patterns of fruit and insect abundance are important factors which may act directly or indirectly to initiate breeding activity so that lactation occurs at a time of greatest food abundance. Finally, intrapopulational differences in age at sexual maturity were found, both between the sexes and among individuals of the same sex.},

  Abstract = {We briefly review the primate-bearing Pondaung mammal fauna (Eocene, Myanmar). The age of the Pondaung fauna has been determined as latest middle Eocene based on the radiometric (fission-track) dates analyzed recently. The Pondaung fauna consists of six orders of mammals, including 22 genera and 29 species. Among the 22 genera, more than half (12 genera) are endemic to this fauna. Although both artiodactyls and perissodactyls are abundant, the former is less diversified in familial and generic numbers than the latter, but is slightly more dominant in collection size [in particular, Anthracotherium (Artiodactyla; Anthracotheriidae) has been most dominantly collected from the field]. This suggests the beginning of the radiation of artiodactyls and decline of perissodactyls in the later Eocene of southern East Asia. Among the Pondaung perissodactyls, brontotheres and amynodonts are dominant in the collection size. The paleoenvironment of the Pondaung fauna is estimated as subtropical/tropical forest with large rivers and patches of open areas near seashore. Among the mammalian genera of the Pondaung fauna, only eight genera were shared with other Eocene faunas of East Asia. On the other hand, the Pondaung fauna shares Anthracotherium with the late Eocene to Oligocene faunas of Europe, and the Pondaung species are more primitive than the European ones. The Pondaung rodent is probably assigned to very primitive phiomyid or anomalurid, both of which had been recorded only in the late Eocene and latter age of Africa/West Asia. These suggest faunal migration from southern East Asia to Africa/West Eurasia during the later Eocene. If the Pondaung primates are really assigned to primitive anthropoids, they might migrate to Africa/West Asia with anthracotheres and/or rodents.},

  Abstract = {In an attempt to properly identify Dasymys specimens that were collectedduring the last decennia in the East-African region (Rwanda-Tanzania) we undertook a revision of this genus. Although we initially limited our study area to central and eastern Africa, we were forced to include specimens for comparison from other areas, including western Africa, Angola and Zimbabwe-Zambia. This revision was realized using craniometric data of nearly 1000 skulls grouped in 20 operational taxonomical units (OTU's) mainly occurring in the central and eastern part of the African continent. The observation that differences in age and sex composition of the OTU's are of no or little consequence for the branching of the obtained phenetic trees, allowed us to undertake the screening of the genus Dasymys of the central and eastern African region. This approach enabled us to evaluate already described taxa, to select a neotype for D. nudipes and to describe three new taxa. Subsequent genetic analysis (cytochrome b) allowed us to provide a genetical characterization of two of the new species and several other taxa. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that the genus Dasymys originated in the west African forest block before spreading in a first step to the forest of the central African region and then in a second step to the savannahs of southern, eastern and possibly also western Africa.},

  Year = {2002},
  Abstract = {A population and habitat viability analysis (PHVA) was carried out for the Malagasy giant jumping rat (Hypogeomys antimena), one of the key species of the highly threatened dry deciduous forests on the western coast of Madagascar. The occurrence of H. antimena is now confined to 200 km2 of fragmented but relatively undisturbed forest remnants, divided in northern and southern subpopulations. Since 1985 the habitat has declined by about 52\% (1985: 42,000 ha; 2000: 20,000 ha). The annual rate of habitat decline increased from 3.9\% between 1985 and 1995 to 4.4\% between 1995 and 2000. Within a study area (Kirindy Forest/CFPF) in the southern subpopulation, the Hypogeomys population collapsed during the decade 1990-2000, as well as over its remaining range. An ongoing population decline within the next 100 years is predicted even if further habitat decline can be stopped within the next 5 years and no additional mortality by roaming dogs is considered. Thereby, the outcomes of two different individual-based simulation approaches, one that was explicitly written to reflect Hypogeomys life history and VORTEX, one of the most common software packages used for this purpose, were compared. The results of the Hypogeomys model were more pessimistic, but were within the range of predictions of the VORTEX model which calculated larger standard deviations of the mean values. In both subpopulations, a slight increase in the mortality caused by roaming dogs resulted in a predicted decline to an average population size of maximal 170 individuals within 100 years with a high risk of extinction. However, the simulations indicated that the most important factor is reduction in habitat. If the actual annual rate of habitat lost continues, the extinction of the both subpopulations and therefore the entire species is predicted within 24 years.},

Evolutionary hypotheses predict that rates of senescence should vary directly with extrinsic mortality and inversely with fecundity. If so, naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber) should live a long time (senesce slowly) because in nature they inhabit heavily protected burrows, and large, old breeding females make disproportionate reproductive contributions. In addition H. glaber has an exceptionally low metabolic rate, which may reduce oxidative stress. We have maintained naked mole-rats in captivity since 1974. Here we report that individuals can live a very long time: many are alive after more than 20 years and some are 26 years old (and counting). Although we do not yet know how long naked mole-rats can live, they already are older than the maximum longevity of all but one of 156 rodent species that have been maintained in captivity from birth to death.},

  Abstract = {Scattered populations of Ruppell's foxes (Vulpes rueppelli) occur across the deserts of northern Africa and Arabia. Little is known about the biology of these canids, especially the physiological mechanisms that contribute to their ability to live in such harsh environments. For individuals from Saudi Arabia, we tested the hypotheses that Ruppell's foxes have a reduced basal metabolic rate and total evaporative water loss (TEWL), parameters measured in the laboratory, and a reduced field metabolic rate (FMR) and water flux when free-living. Under basal conditions in the laboratory, males, which averaged 1,858 g in body mass, had an oxygen consumption of 914.9 mL O2/h, whereas females, which weighed on average 1,233 g, consumed 682.9 mL O2/h; rates of oxygen consumption translated to 441.4 kJ/d and 329.4 kJ/d, respectively. TEWL averaged 52.6 g H2O/d for males and 47.5 g H2O/d for females. We found no evidence that basal metabolism is reduced in Ruppell's foxes, but their TEWL was remarkably low: 50.9\% of allometric prediction for males and 64.5\% for females. In the wild during winter, males expended energy at a rate of 1,306.5 kJ/d, whereas females had an expenditure of 722.8 kJ/d. Analysis of covariance with FMR as the dependent variable, sex as a fixed factor, and body mass as a covariate showed no statistical difference in FMR between sexes. Water flux did not differ significantly between sexes and averaged 123 mL H2O/d, a value 30\% lower than the kit fox from the deserts of southwestern North America. FMR was positively related to nocturnal activity levels as FMR (kJ/d)=-2,900.1+55.5 (\% of time moving). The water content of prey items varied between 1.9 and 4.1 g H2O/g dry matter consumed. Based on these values and knowledge of their diet, we calculated that foxes captured about one rodent and a variety of anthropods per night of foraging.},

  Abstract = {Most large-seeded shrubs and trees from Mediterranean shrublands are either serotinous (canopy stored seeds) or myrmecochorous (ant-buried). It has been hypothesized that these traits evolved to prevent access to the seeds by rodents. Here we present the first field evidence of a third guild, scatter-hoarding of nuts in the genus Leucadendron (Proteaceae) from the south-west Cape. The rodent concerned is Acomys subspinosus, a small ([{\textless}]20 g) south-west Cape endemic murid. Seeds are typically buried singly, less than 2 cm deep and at distances of up to 5 m from seed depots. This finding has implications for the understanding of the evolution of myrmecochory and serotiny in shrublands. It extends the evolution of cached-nuts to a new family and is one of the first records of scatter-hoarding, outside of forests, in the southern hemisphere.},

Mean values of heterozygosity per locus for each species ranged from 0.02 to 0.04. Mean values of Nei's genetic distance (D) between the taxa ranged from 0.06 (between A. flavicollis and A. alpicola) to 1.34 (between A. uralensis and A. agrarius). The highest values of D were found between A. agrarius and other Apodemus species (0.62-1.34). These values correspond to those generally observed between genera in small mammals. Our data show that A. agrarius and A. peninsulae are sister species, well-differentiated from other taxa. High genetic distance between A. m. mystacinus and A. m. epimelas leads us to consider them distinct species and sister taxa to other Western Palaearctic species of the subgenus Sylvaemus. The data also suggest a recent separation of members of the latter group from a common ancestor, and subsequent rapid radiation, making it difficult to infer phylogenetic relationships.

  Year = {2002},
  Doi = {10.1007/s00265-001-0432-4},
  Abstract = {The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) encodes a group of closely linked genes that play a central role in the vertebrate immune system. Most natural mammal populations studied so far possess high levels of diversity within the MHC. However, recent investigations in the MHC class II gene DQA of the critically endangered Malagasy giant jumping rat (Hypogeomys antimena) revealed very low variability compared to other mammalian species. The low genetic variability was confirmed in the present study through analyses of the MHC class II gene DRB exon 2. This codes for the antigen-binding site and is therefore considered as one of the most important parts of the MHC. The species' geographic distribution has been reduced recently to a fragmented area of suitable habitat within a geographic range of less than 20[x]40 km of dry deciduous forest at the west coast of Madagascar. H. antimena has some unusual life history characteristics for a rodent species, such as living in obligate monogamy, with pairs staying together until one mate dies, a low reproduction rate (one to two offspring/couple per year), high site and mate fidelity, short dispersal distances, almost no adult migration, and therefore a constant gene pool with very limited gene flow. Current hypotheses usually interpret low MHC polymorphism either as a consequence of reduced selection pressure, bottleneck effects or by constraints of the mating system. To differentiate between these hypotheses, the MHC variability of the DQA and DRB gene of two additional sympatric, but widely distributed rodent species, Macrotarsomys bastardi and Eliurus myoxinus, were studied by using universal primers and single-strand conformation polymorphism. The two species differ in their mating systems: M. bastardi also lives in pairs but E. myoxinus is a promiscuous species. Whereas the investigated MHC class II genes DQA and DRB had low levels of polymorphism in the pair-living species H. antimena and M. bastardi (DQA: 2 and 3 alleles, DRB: 5 and 6 alleles, respectively), higher levels of variation (DQA: 11 alleles, DRB: 9 alleles) were recorded in the promiscuous species, E. myoxinus. Gene diversity was also higher in E. myoxinus (DQA: 0.85, DRB: 0.86) than in the two pair-living species (DQA: 0.41-0.45, DRB: 0.55-0.63). The results suggest that low MHC variability might not only result from bottleneck effects due to recent declines in population size, but also from a monogamous mating system.},

  Abstract = {We have sequenced 965 base pairs of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b (mtDNA cyt b) from 102 woodmice (Apodemus sylvaticus) samples collected from 40 European localities The aims of the study were to answer the following questions: i) Did the Mediterranean peninsulas play a role as a refuge for small mammals? ii) Is the genetic variability of a small mammal like A. svlvaticus higher in the Mediterranean regions as compared with northern Europe? iii) Is it possible to find patterns of postglacial colonisation of Europe other than those presently recognised? Sequence data were analysed using Distance and Maximum Parsimony phylogenetic reconstruction methods. A minimum spanning network was also calculated. Population genetic structure was determined by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). A (mismatch distribution) analysis was also performed to estimate the patterns of expansion. The results provide a clear picture of the impact of Quaternary glaciations on the genetic and geographic stricture of the woodmouse. Analyses indicate a higher genetic variability for the woodmouse in the Mediterranean peninsulas as compared to northern Europe and the role of these peninsulas as refuge regions for small mammals. A new pattern of postglacial colonisation is also proposed where the Iberian and southern France refuge populations colonised almost all the European regions. The Sicilian population appears to be highly differentiated and highly variable. This result emphasises the importance of this island as a (hot spot) for the intraspecific genetic diversity of the woodmouse. Finally, populations of this species in North Africa originated from south-western Europe and are probably the result of a recent anthropogenic introduction.},

  Abstract = {Three specimens of M. minutoides/musculoides from Zambia were cytogenetically studied through G- and C-banding, DAPI staining and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) with a (TTAGGG)n telomeric sequence. Biarmed chromosomes were identified according to the current nomenclature as follows: Rb(2.7), Rb(3.12), Rb(4.5), Rb(6.8), Rb(9.16), and the sex chromosomes Rb(1.X), Rb(1.Y) and Rb(1.Xd), originated from the deleted X chromosome. One female showed the diploid number 2n = 24; in the two other individuals, the Rb(9.16) occurred in a heteromorphic condition, and, accordingly, the diploid number was 2n = 25. FISH showed the sites of telomeric sequences at telomeres of all the chromosomes, and in an interstitial position at the centromeres of all Robertsonian metacentrics, except one - the Rb(6.8), though the patterns of hybridization varied between chromosomes. Sex chromosome pairs, in the male and females, showed a similar C-banding pattern, but revealed clear differences after FISH. Traces of telomeric sequences were found dispersed in the whole-heterochromatic arm of the Rb(1.Xd). No visible bond between C-positive heterochromatin and telomeric sequences were detected in the other either bi- or uniarmed chromosomes, indicating that they may actually represent retained telomeres in the Robertsonian metacentrics.},

  Abstract = {Here were investigates fixation of Cadmium (Cd) by the kidney, liver and duodenum and its effects on the body weight gain and the serum level of calcium in Meriones shawi shawi a gerbillid species which is distributed in Tunisia. Field investigations revel that in the industrial zone of Sfax the average Cd content in the kidneys is significantly higher than that in the laboratory controls, animals captured in 40 km north-west of Sfax and animals from Hergla in center of Tunisia. The Cd contamination of the soil and vegetation which constitutes the main food source of Meriones s. shawi accounts partly for these rates. The body weight and serum level of calcium in the animals of these two stations are comparable to those of the laboratory controls. Laboratory investigations of animals of both sexes (n=24) reveal that when 1 g Cd/1 l H2O/1.5 kg granules is added to their diet, the average Cd content in the kidney increases significantly during the treatment: from 0.2 [mu]g/g dry weight in the controls to 103 [mu]g/dry weight after 30 days. However, this content stabilizes in the liver between 20 and 30 days, and in the duodenum between 5 and 30 days treatment. After 30 days of the experimentation, the body weight gain is of 19\% in comparison to the initial weight. It is 3 times less in the supplemented animals. Serum level of calcium decreases significantly after 10 days treatment. All these results show that the kidney of Meriones s. shawi can be considered as the preferential organ for Cd fixation, this metal alters body weight gain and the serum level of calcium. This mammal species would be considered as an indicator of Cd pollution.},

Fifty-one litters were obtained from 17 pairs, with a mean litter size of 2.09, reproductive effort of 0.58 and gestation period of 37 days. Neonates weighed 6.1-9.6 g and were semi-precocial. Weaning began as early as 8 days of age, and the age at first reproduction was 6 weeks in males and 5 weeks in females. Compared to its congeners, O. unisulcatus has small litters of semi-precocial young which undergo rapid postnatal development, and contrary to expectations displays several K-selected reproductive characteristics. The reproductive biology and postnatal development of the bush Karoo appears to reflect a compromise between exploiting sporadically abundant resources and the occupation of stick lodges, which may provide a favourable microclimate to buffer the harsh external climate.},

  Abstract = {Field survey of known and potential cheetah habitats in the northern sector of the Egyptian Western Desert was carried out to collect data on the present distribution and status of that animal in Egypt. Data were also gathered on the ecological characteristics of present cheetah habitats and the status of known and potential cheetah prey species in the area. Impacts of human activities on the cheetah, and on its preys and habitats were also investigated. The results show that the cheetah has disappeared from most of its former range in the northern part of the Egyptian Western Desert. Its entire population has been reduced to what appears to be few individuals confined to a highly inaccessible area in the northern and western parts of the Qattara Depression. These individuals appear to be essentially nomadic, roaming over a vast area of the desert in search of prey. Habitats presently occupied by the cheetah in Egypt include uninhabited oasis depressions within the Qattara Depression. Large groves of Acacia raddiana west and southwest of these habitats appear to be regularly visited by cheetahs. The survey also showed that gazelles, which constitute an important cheetah prey item, have been largely exterminated throughout the study area as a result of uncontrolled illegal hunting, with the exception of a small population which still survives in the western part of the Qattara Depression. Cape hare and several rodent species are numerous throughout present cheetah habitats, and may constitute the main cheetah prey in that area. We compare morphological characters of cheetahs of the Egyptian Western Desert to those of cheetahs from different parts of the world range of A. jubatus. Stringent conservation measures are needed to save this rare and possibly unique population of the cheetah.},

The 1025 collected rodents were divided according to species, gender, age, and weight. El-Amryia and El-Montaza were the most infested districts, while West, East, Middle and El-Gomrok Districts were the lowest infested ones. Rattus norvegicus was the highest abundant species in the city (41.9\%) followed by R. rattus (37.2\%), then Mus musculus (20.9\%). There was no difference in abundance of rodents during summer compared with winter. Meanwhile, males represented 57.6\% of the total collected rodents. Most of the collected rodents were ltoreq2 months old (63.8\%) or light weighed (61.6\%) however, number of caught rodents became less and less as age or weight increased. Concerning El-Amryia and El-Montaza Districts where abattoirs are located, number of collected rodents from and around the abattoirs represented 70.4\% of the total collected rodents compared with 29.6\% collected from and around the houses of the same districts. The total prevalence of T. spiralis infection among collected rodents using digestion technique was 13.3\%. El-Amryia, El-Montaza, West and El-Gomrok Districts were, in order, the only infected districts. Neither gender nor season of collection has influence on the prevalence of infection. The present study proved the role of abattoirs in the prevalence of T. spiralis infection. However, high prevalence of T. spiralis infection was detected among higher age or higher body weight groups of rodents. Sensitivity of the digestion diagnostic technique is proved compared with compressorium diagnostic technique. Nevertheless, diaphragm was the most sensitive site for detection of light infection in all studied rodents followed by thigh then tongue; expressed as number of larvae per gram tissue.},

  Abstract = {Aim: The modern African murine rodent Oenomys is a semiarboreal genus characteristic of the rain forest zone. The size and shape geographical differentiation is studied in order to discuss the possible evolutionary patterns and constraints leading to this distribution. Location: Two species of Oenomys have been previously recognized, corresponding to the West African forest block on the one hand and to the main forest block on the other hand. Both species have been sampled, and forty localities permit the study of the whole geographical range of Oenomys, from Guinea to Kenya. Methods: A Fourier analysis applied to the outlines of the first upper and lower molars allows a quantification of the size and shape variations across the geographical range of Oenomys. Results: This morphometrical analysis defines three morphological groups of Oenomys, corresponding to the West, Central, and East African forest zone. This result suggests the existence of an additional cryptic species. The Western group is characterized by broad asymmetrical molars and a small size. The Central African group has more elongated and larger molars while the Eastern African group displays extremely constricted molars and a small size. Main conclusion: The shape can be considered as charactheristic of each group and its variations appear to be mostly related to phylogeny while size exhibits variations within each group related to climatic gradients. This discrepancy could be related to different genetic determinants for both characters, the shape being strongly genetically constrained while size can vary according to a wide range of environmental factors.},

  Abstract = {The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region and flanking tRNAs were sequenced from 76 mice collected at 60 localities extending from Egypt through Turkey, Yemen, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nepal to eastern Asia. Segments of the Y chromosome and of a processed p53 pseudogene (PSIp53) were amplified from many of these mice and from others collected elsewhere in Eurasia and North Africa. The 251 mtDNA types, including 54 new ones reported here, now identified from commensal house mice (Mus musculus group) by sequencing this segment can be organized into four major lineages - domesticus, musculus, castaneus, and a new lineage found in Yemen. Evolutionary tree analysis suggested the domesticus mtDNAs as the sister group to the other three commensal mtDNA lineages and the Yemeni mtDNAs as the next oldest lineage. Using this tree and the phylogeographic approach, we derived a new model for the origin and radiation of commensal house mice whose main features are an origin in west-central Asia (within the present-day range of M. domesticus) and the sequential spreading of mice first to the southern Arabian Peninsula, thence eastward and northward into south-central Asia, and later from south-central Asia to north-central Asia (and thence into most of northern Eurasia) and to southeastern Asia. Y chromosomes with and without an 18-bp deletion in the Zfy-2 gene were detected among mice from Iran and Afghanistan, while only undeleted Ys were found in Turkey, Yemen, Pakistan, and Nepal. Polymorphism for the presence of a PSIp53 was observed in Georgia, Iran, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Sequencing of a 128-bp PSIp53 segment from 79 commensal mice revealed 12 variable sites and implicated gtoreq14 alleles. The allele that appeared to be phylogenetically ancestral was widespread, and the greatest diversity was observed in Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nepal. Two mice provided evidence for a second PSIp53 locus in some commensal populations.},

  Volume = {244},
  Year = {1998},
  Abstract = {Analysis of 904 small carnivore scats collected over a two-year period in a seasonal forest in the southwestern Central African Republic yielded the remains of 732 shrews, rodents ({\textless} 1 kg), and bats comprising at least 34 species. Most scats belonged to the long-nosed mongoose, Herpestes naso, the numerically dominant carnivore in the study area. Shrews were the principal small mammal prey with respect to number of individuals and frequency of occurrence. The mean monthly frequency of occurrence of shrews was 21.7\% and of small rodents ({\textless}100 g) was 20.8\%. Both shrews and small rodents occurred significantly more often in scats collected during dry season months, and live-trapping of rodents over a 22-month period revealed similar peaks in availability. In contrast to many mammalian carnivores, shrews did not appear to be used as an alternative prey source: not only did consumption levels of both prey types fluctuate in synchrony, but the availability of rodents apparently had no effect upon the likelihood of including shrews in the diet. Preferential use of small mammals by long-nosed mongooses was tested for the 10 rodent species for which abundance indices were calculated. Mongooses preyed selectively on several rodent species (Praomys spp., Deomys ferrugineus, Stochomys longicaudatus, and Grammomys rutilans), while the most common rodent in the study area, Hylomyscus spp., was found in scats at lower frequencies than expected. In accordance with the habitat specificities of these 'preferred' rodent prey, it is suggested that mongooses and perhaps other small carnivores were foraging in micro-habitats characterized by higher-than-average vegetation understorey thickness where the simultaneous rate of encounter with arthropods, their main prey, and shrews was apt to be high.},

Staining with DNA dyes showed variation in intensity of fluorescence of the sperm chromatin, with an anterior spherical region staining far more intensely than the surrounding chromatin. Transmission electron microscopy of these spermatozoa indicated that this region was composed of cords and fibres. This chromatin region dispersed more readily than the surrounding chromatin when spermatozoa were incubated with the detergents, and it is suggested that, unlike the rest of the sperm chromatin, it may be a histone-rich region, with protamine(s) being either scarce or absent.},

  Abstract = {Hypogeomys antimena, the largest endemic rodent of Madagascar, is exclusively found in a restricted area of less than 1000 km-2 in the deciduous dry forest near the western coast. The facts so far known about its biology, like pair bonds, 1-2 offspring, lack of sexual dimorphism, and the results of a nine-week trapping and radiotracking field study (Cook et al., 1991) suggest monogamy, a rare social system occurring in only 3\% of mammals. By using the same methods of trapping and radiotracking during different seasons, investigations in the proposed social system were carried out and provided a medium-term view of the social structure. The data on Hypogeomys antimena were then used to test hypotheses about the evolution of monogamy in rodents by comparing spacing behaviour and the size of home ranges of males and females before (dry season) and after (rainy season) the birth of offspring. Males and females from neighbouring burrows have similarly-sized but mutually exclusive home ranges. Home ranges of pairs trapped at the same burrows, however, always overlapped extensively. The morphological correlates (no sexual differences in the body measurements, small testes in relation to body size) are those of monogamous species. Pairs remain associated during both breeding and non-breeding periods and pair bonds seem to continue for more than one reproductive season. Offspring stay together with their parents for at least one more year, implying that sexual maturation is probably not reached before the age of two years. The results are consistent with the previous suggestion that Hypogeomys antimena lives in a monogamous social system. Home ranges are larger during the dry season before birth than during the rainy season after the birth of offspring. Pairs with offspring had smaller home ranges than those without. Males tended to stay closer to the offspring than females.},

  Abstract = {The mountain forest archipelago of south-east Nigeria and west Cameroun is known to be an important biogeographical region. A constantly increasing number of endemic taxa is being described. The present morphometrical revision of the Lophuromys in museum collections from this mountain-range allowed us to identify and describe two new endemic species. Lophuromys roseveari sp.n. belongs craniometrically to the "unspeckled" L. sikapusi species complex and seems to have a distribution restricted to the mountain forest belt on Mt Cameroun. Lophuromys dieterleni sp.n. is morphologically and morphometrically related to the L. flavopunctatus species complex but has an "unspeckled" pelage. This taxon is endemic to the mountain forests of Mt Oku and seems to be sympatric with L. sikapusi. Its closest relative is L. eisentrauti, endemic to the nearby Mt Lefo mountain. It is likely that new taxa will be described whenever a generic revision is undertaken but the present list of endemic mammals is already sufficiently impressive to classify the mountain forests of Mt Cameroun and Mt Oku as high priority regions for the conservation of African mammal diversity.},

In order to study the possible origin of these insular populations, rats were caught on many Mediterranean (Sicily, Sardinia, Lavezzi, Corsica, Elba, Porquerolles) and Atlantic islands (Re, Oleron, Azores) and compared to animals from continental Europe (Spain), and Africa (Tunisia, Benin). Their karyotype was determined and their mtDNA restriction patterns studied using the HAE III and RSA I endonucleases and a polyacrylamide get electrophoresis. These patterns appear very similar to each other though one of them is specific to the African animals, probably indicating that Europe and Africa were colonised by different strains.},

  Volume = {66},
  Year = {1996},
  Abstract = {In order to define precisely a new murid species from the Zaire lowland rainforest, a revision of the systematics of the related Lophuromys nudicaudus was essential. Analysis of the morphological and metrical data of the types and other museum-specimens showed that Lophuromys huttereri sp.nov. is a welldefined species inhabiting probably the greater part of the lowland rainforest of the South-Central faunal region south of the Zaire River. Lophuromys nudicaudus on the other hand has a zoogeographical distribution covering probably the whole of the West-Central lowland rainforest between the north bank of the Zaire River and the Cross River (Gabon/RioMuni/R.C.A./ Cameroon/ Congo). Since one nudicaudus specimen (KMMA 6251) was collected in Basoko, far to the east of this region, it is probable that further collecting will prove it to be also present in the lowland rainforest on the right bank of the Zaire between the Ubangui and the Aruwimi rivers. Finally, there are indications (1) that specimens from the region between the Cross and Sanaga rivers differ sufficiently from typical nudicaudus to warrant taxonomical recognition under the subspecific name tullbergi and (2) that the Bioko-population, described under the subspecific name parvulus, is very close to its mainland counterpart and should therefore be put into synonymy with tullbergi.},

  Abstract = {The Kibale Forest, western Uganda, is the only site where studies have compared the impact of elephants on rainforest regeneration in logged and unlogged control areas. Elephants used heavily logged areas more than lightly logged and unlogged areas. Forest gaps were used more by elephants than closed-canopy areas and large gaps more than small ones. Gaps were larger in logged than unlogged forest. There were lower densities of young trees (saplings and poles) and a higher incidence of elephant damage to them in heavily logged forest than in lightly logged and unlogged sites. Elephant use of area and damage to young trees was inversely or unrelated to the density of young trees and directly related to the density of herbaceous tangle. Heavy togging resulted in large areas of herbaceous tangle, which attracted elephants who suppressed forest regeneration by damaging voting trees and perpetuating the herbaceous tangle. The tangle directly competed with regeneration of young trees while also attracting elephants and rodents (seed and seedling predators) and facilitating increased windthrow of trees. Selective browsing of young trees by elephants affected rates of regeneration, growth form and species composition. Rather than remove elephants, a more effective and humane approach to long-term management of logging is to reduce logging offtake and incidental damage caused by timber extraction.},

When bred under controlled conditions in captivity, these animals are called 'minilivestock', a term also used for those small species that are little known in animal production. To qualify as minilivestock, animals must have a potential benefit either nutritionally for food or economically for animal-feed or revenue, and currently not being utilized to their full potential. Rodents are eaten in Africa and Latin America. The guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) is considered a particularly efficient meat source. Giant African snails (Achatina spp) are highly prized as food in West and Central Africa and Asia, and are produced commercially. Annelids living in litter and manure convert vegetable refuse to animal protein which can be used as feed for pigs and poultry. There is a continuous demand for frogs' legs on the international market and also for many species of insect, alive or mounted. The development of minilivestock will contribute to meeting human needs and will also protect the environment from excessive harvesting.},

Both species were diurnal. Galerella did not use dens, whereas Cynictis never rested outside a den. Total distance moved, home range size and density did not differ between the two species. Galerella frequented bush, whereas Cynictis frequented open fields. The yellow mongoose was more social than the grey mongoose, but the basic social structure was similar. Faeces of Cynictis were found in large clumps close to the dens, while those of Galerella were more scattered. This parallels the greater constancy of use of the sleeping sites by Cynictis. Rodents ( gt 90\% of Cape grey mongoose diet) were much more abundant in the bush, while availability of insects (main food source for the yellow mongoose) was higher in the open fields. Habitat selection, through its effects on anti-predator and feeding strategies, might have been the leading factor in the evolution of sociality in herpestids.},

  Abstract = {Allozyme diversity in the superspecies Spalax ehrenbergi has been revisited by studying 36 gene loci in 241 subterranean mole rats from 22 populations and nine chromosomal species, four from Turkey (2n = 52E (east), 52W (west), 56 and 58), four from Israel (2n = 52, 54, 58 and 60), and one from Egypt (2n = 60). The following results were indicated. (1) Genetic patterns: 11 of the 36 loci analysed (30.5 per cent) were monomorphic across the range, fifteen (41.7 per cent) were weakly polymorphic and the remaining 10 loci (27.8 per cent) were strongly polymorphic. (2) Heterozygosity: the average H was 0.051, range 0.00-0.098. In Israel, H increased with aridity and climatic unpredictability towards the northern Negev Desert, and was remarkably high in small steppic semi-isolates and desert isolates. (3) Species discrimination: some of the S. ehrenbergi species can be discriminated qualitatively. (4) Genetic distances (D): between species these values averaged 0.077, range 0.001-0.269, with the highest D between the ancestor Turkish and descendant Israeli and Egyptian species. The phylogenetic tree supports the Turkish origin of the Israeli Spalax ehrenbergi species, and the recent speciation of the Egyptian Spalax. (5) Genetic diversity is mostly (58 per cent) within populations. (6) Allozyme correlates: allozyme diversity was significantly correlated with the external physical (both climatic and edaphic) and biotic (parasite infection and plant cover) environment. (7) Spatial autocorrelation of allozyme frequencies suggests that migration is not influential. (8) Gametic phase disequilibria were significant in four out of five species tested, and were associated with climatic and edaphic factors. These results support the environmental selection hypothesis of genetic diversity including the niche-width variation hypothesis in space and time. Natural selection appears to play a major role in genetic differentiation of proteins in adaptive radiation and speciation.},

  Abstract = {The hallmark of arenaviruses is their tendency to cause persistent silent infections in their natural hosts (rodents) and severe, often lethal, disseminated disease in humans. Arenaviruses are pleomorphic enveloped particles that contain two RNA segments of virus origin and ribosome-like components. Suitable conditions for transmission of virus to humans occur in areas where humans come in contact with rodent urine that contains virus. Persistent viremia and viruria in rodents result from a slow or insufficient immune response when immunologically immature fetuses or neonates are infected. In humans, the disease is acute. There are five pathogens of humans, who are only accidental hosts. Four cause severe hemorrhagic fever with a mortality of about 15 percent among hospitalized patients in circumscribed areas (Lassa virus in West Africa, Junin virus in the Argentine pampas, Machupo virus in Bolivia, and Guanarito virus in Venezuela). The fifth, lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus, is much more widely distributed, but causes milder infections, often neurologic.

  Abstract = {Endemic to West Africa and South America, mammalian arenaviruses can cross the species barrier from their natural rodent hosts to humans, resulting in illnesses ranging from mild flu-like syndromes to severe and fatal haemorrhagic zoonoses. The increased frequency of outbreaks and associated high fatality rates of the most prevalent arenavirus, Lassa, in West African countries, highlights the significant risk to public health and to the socio-economic development of affected countries. The devastating impact of these viruses is further exacerbated by the lack of approved vaccines and effective treatments. Differential immune responses to arenavirus infections that can lead to either clearance or rapid, widespread and uncontrolled viral dissemination are modulated by the arenavirus multifunctional proteins, NP and Z. These two proteins control the antiviral response to infection by targeting multiple cellular pathways; and thus, represent attractive targets for antiviral development to counteract infection. The interplay between the host immune responses and viral replication is a key determinant of virus pathogenicity and disease outcome. In this review, we examine the current understanding of host immune defenses against arenavirus infections and summarise the host protein interactions of NP and Z and the mechanisms that govern immune evasion strategies.},

LASV infection of humans can cause Lassa fever (LF), a disease associated with high morbidity and significant mortality. Recent evidence indicates an LASV expansion outside its traditional endemic areas. In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) included LASV in top-priority pathogens and released a Target Product Profile (TPP) for vaccine development. Likewise, in 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration added LF to a priority review voucher program to encourage the development of preventive and therapeutics measures. In this article, we review recent progress in LASV vaccine research and development with a focus on the impact of LASV genetic and biological diversity on the design and development of vaccine candidates meeting the WHO's TPP for an LASV vaccine.},

  Abstract = {Lassa fever is a unique viral hemorrhagic fever that is endemic in parts of West Africa, primarily Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Nigeria. The disease is caused by the Lassa virus, an Old World arenavirus that has as primary reservoir host the multimammate rodent Mastomys nataliensis, which lives in association with humans. Recent estimates suggest LF causes two million cases and 5000-10000 deaths annually, mainly in West Africa. Clinical diagnosis and laboratory confirmation have always been major challenges for effective management and control of the disease in afflicted areas of West Africa. Recent advancements in molecular biology, recombinant DNA technology, and genomics sequencing has facilitated major advancement in development of better diagnostic and surveillance tools for Lassa fever virus. These include, the multiplex, magnetic bead-based immunodiagnostics for both Lassa virus antigens and antibodies; molecular probe-based quantitative real-time PCR for genomic signatures; rapid diagnostics tests that detects the most prevalent West African lineages; and the successful utilization of next-generation sequencing technology to diagnose and characterize Lassa virus in West Africa. These advances will continue to improve disease treatment, control, and prevention. In this review we will discuss progression of Lassa virus diagnostics from the past and into the future.

  Abstract = {Lassa virus (LASV) is a rodent-borne arenavirus endemic to several West African countries that causes Lassa fever (LF). LF is typically mild but it can cause severe disease characterized by hemorrhagic fever and multi-organ failure. A current outbreak of LASV in Nigeria has seen greater than 300 cases with a case fatality rate of 22\%. Currently, there are limited treatment options and no vaccine candidates are approved to prevent LASV infection. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations has identified LASV as an emerging pathogen of high consequence and this has resulted in a push for several preclinical vaccine candidates to be advanced toward clinical trials. Here, we discuss several important aspects of LASV infection including immunobiology, immune evasion, and correlates of protection against LF, which have been identified through animal models and human infections. In addition, we discuss several vaccine candidates that have shown efficacy in animal models that could be advanced toward clinical trials. The increased fatality rate seen in the recent LASV outbreak in Nigeria highlights the importance of developing effective treatment and prevention strategies against LF. The spike in LASV cases seen in West Africa has the potential for increased mortality and human-to-human transmission, making the development and testing of effective vaccines for LASV critical.},

  Abstract = {Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) is a zoonotic disease caused by several Borrelia species transmitted to humans by Ornithodoros tick vectors. In West Africa, Borrelia crocidurae is a common cause of disease in many rural populations. Small mammals act as reservoirs of infection. We report here the results of surveys that investigated the occurrence of B. crocidurae infection in rodents and insectivores from eight countries of West and Central Africa. Animals were identified at the species level and tested for Borrelia either by examination of thick blood film, intra-peritoneal inoculation of blood or brain tissues into laboratory mice, or by molecular techniques. A total of 4358 small mammals belonging to 38 species and 7 families were collected, including 3225 specimens collected in areas where the occurrence of Ornithodoros sonrai tick in rodent burrows was documented, and 1133 in areas where this tick was absent. In areas with O. sonrai, Borrelia infection was demonstrated in 287 of 3109 (9.2\%) small mammals tested, and none was documented in 1004 animals tested from other areas. There was no relationship between the occurrence of Rhipicephalus, Hyaloma and Argas ticks in burrows and the distribution of Borrelia infection in small mammals. The 287 specimens infected by Borrelia belonged to 15 rodent and shrew species, including three Saharo-Sahelian species - Gerbillus gerbillus, Gerbillus occiduus and Gerbillus tarabuli - identified as reservoirs for TBRF with a distribution restricted to this area. In Sudan and Sudano-Sahelian areas, Arvicanthis niloticus, Mastomys erythroleucus and Mastomys huberti were the main reservoir of infection. Although most small mammals species collected had a large distribution in West and Central Africa, the fact that only animals collected in areas with O. sonrai were found infected suggest that this tick is the only vector of TBRF in rodents and insectivores in this part of Africa.

  Abstract = {Lassa fever is a disease that has been reported from sites across West Africa; it is caused by an arenavirus that is hosted by the rodent M. natalensis. Although it is confined to West Africa, and has been documented in detail in some well-studied areas, the details of the distribution of risk of Lassa virus infection remain poorly known at the level of the broader region. In this paper, we explored the effects of certainty of diagnosis, oversampling in well-studied region, and error balance on results of mapping exercises. Each of the three factors assessed in this study had clear and consistent influences on model results, overestimating risk in southern, humid zones in West Africa, and underestimating risk in drier and more northern areas. The final, adjusted risk map indicates broad risk areas across much of West Africa. Although risk maps are increasingly easy to develop from disease occurrence data and raster data sets summarizing aspects of environments and landscapes, this process is highly sensitive to issues of data quality, sampling design, and design of analysis, with macrogeographic implications of each of these issues and the potential for misrepresenting real patterns of risk.},

Here, we evaluated BLI as a novel approach for tracking MPX virus infection in black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). Prairie dogs were affected during a multistate outbreak of MPX in the US in 2003 and have since been used as an animal model of this disease. Our BLI results were compared with PCR and virus isolation from tissues collected postmortem. Virus was easily detected and quantified in skin and superficial tissues by BLI before and during clinical phases, as well as in subclinical secondary cases, but was not reliably detected in deep tissues such as the lung. Although there are limitations to viral detection in larger wild rodent species, BLI can enhance the use of prairie dogs as an animal model of MPX and can be used for the study of infection, disease progression, and transmission in potential wild rodent reservoirs.},

  Abstract = {This paper summarizes the progress in the search for hantaviruses and hantavirus infections in Africa. After having collected molecular evidence of an indigenous African hantavirus in 2006, an intensive investigation for new hantaviruses has been started in small mammals. Various novel hantaviruses have been molecularly identified not only in rodents but also in shrews and bats. In addition, the first African hantavirus, Sangassou virus, has been isolated and functionally characterized in cell culture. Less is known about the ability of these hantaviruses to infect humans and to cause diseases. To date, no hantavirus genetic material could be amplified from patients' specimens collected in Africa. Serological studies in West Africa, based on a battery of screening and confirmatory assays, led to the detection of hantavirus antibodies in the human population and in patients with putative hantavirus disease. In addition to this overview, we present original data from seroepidemiological and field studies conducted in the Southern part of Africa. A human seroprevalence rate of 1.0\% (n=1442) was detected in the South African Cape Region whereas no molecular evidence for the presence of hantavirus was found in 2500 small animals trapped in South Africa and Namibia.

  Abstract = {Lassa virus (LASV) is the causative agent of Lassa Fever and is responsible for several hundred thousand infections and thousands of deaths annually in West Africa. LASV and the non-pathogenic Mopeia virus (MOPV) are both rodent-borne African arenaviruses. A live attenuated reassortant of MOPV and LASV, designated ML29, protects rodents and primates from LASV challenge and appears to be more attenuated than MOPV. To gain better insight into LASV-induced pathology and mechanism of attenuation we performed gene expression profiling in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) exposed to LASV and the vaccine candidate ML29. PBMC from healthy human subjects were exposed to either LASV or ML29. Although most PBMC are non-permissive for virus replication, they remain susceptible to signal transduction by virus particles. Total RNA was extracted and global gene expression was evaluated during the first 24 hours using high-density microarrays. Results were validated using RT-PCR, flow cytometry and ELISA. LASV and ML29 elicited differential expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG), as well as genes involved in apoptosis, NF-kB signaling and the coagulation pathways. These genes could eventually serve as biomarkers to predict disease outcomes. The remarkable differential expression of thrombomodulin, a key regulator of inflammation and coagulation, suggests its involvement with vascular abnormalities and mortality in Lassa fever disease.},

  Abstract = {A number of viruses in the family Arenaviridae cause severe illness in humans. Lassa virus in West Africa and a number of agents in South America produce hemorrhagic fever in persons exposed to aerosolized excretions of the pathogens' rodent hosts. Because arenaviruses are not transmitted by arthropods, and person-to-person spread is rare, human infections occur singly and sporadically, and are usually not diagnosed until the patient is severely ill. Because the arenaviruses are naturally transmitted by the airborne route, they also pose a potential threat as aerosolized bioterror weapons. The broad-spectrum antiviral drug ribavirin was shown to reduce mortality from Lassa fever, and has been tested against Argentine hemorrhagic fever, but it is not an approved treatment for either disease. Human immune convalescent plasma was proven to be effective for Argentine hemorrhagic fever in a controlled trial. New treatments are needed to block viral replication without causing toxicity and to prevent the increased vascular permeability that is responsible for hypotension and shock. In this paper, we review current developments in the experimental therapy of severe arenaviral infections, focusing on drugs that have been tested in animal models, and provide a perspective on future research.},

  Abstract = {Lassa fever is an acute viral zoonotic illness caused by Lassa virus, an arenavirus known to be responsible for a severe haemorrhagic fever characterised by fever, muscle aches, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and, chest and abdominal pain. The virus exhibits persistent, asymptomatic infection with profuse urinary virus excretion in the ubiquitous rodent vector, Mastomys natalensis. Lassa fever is endemic in West Africa and has been reported from Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Nigeria. Some studies indicate that 300,000 to 500,000 cases of Lassa fever and 5000 deaths occur yearly across West Africa. Studies reported in English, that investigated Lassa fever with reference to West Africa were identified using the Medline Entrez-PubMed search and were used for this review. The scarcity of resources available for health care delivery system and the political instability that characterise the West African countries would continue to impede efforts for the control of Lassa fever in the sub-region. There is need for adequate training of health care workers regarding diagnostics, intensive care of patients under isolation, contact tracing, adequate precautionary measures in handling infectious laboratory specimens, control of the vector as well as care and disposal of infectious waste.

  Abstract = {Lassa fever remains a serious challenge to public health in West Africa threatening both local residents in rural areas and those who serve them, particularly medical care providers. Given the ecology of the rodent host and conditions in the endemic area, a vaccine is mandatory for control. The challenge is to overcome the scientific, political and economic obstacles to producing a human use vaccine candidate. There are some scientific issues to resolve. It is known that the G-protein confers protection but we do not know its duration. If the N-protein is also included there may be a better duration of protection but it is unclear whether the N-protein as a vaccine may possibly enhance the infection. The original vaccinia vector must be replaced by new vectors, chimeras or by delivering DNA in some format. A live vaccine is attractive because it can confer protection in a single shot. A killed vaccine is more stable, particularly for distribution in the tropics but usually requires repeated shots. For practical reasons a live vaccine format should probably be pursued, which could then be combined with a yellow fever vaccine, using the same cold chains, since this disease occupies the same endemic areas in West Africa. Lassa vaccine initiatives have suffered from a lack of funding in the past but bioterrorism has brought new resources to Lassa virus science. Adequate funding and applications of new vaccine technologies give hope that we may soon see a vaccine in clinical trials. However, the difficulty of conducting trials in endemic areas and lack of political stability remain serious problems. [References: 61]},

  Abstract = {Since 1996, there have been reports of cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the town of Ouagadougou. The incidence has been on the rise but precise figures are not known. The object of the present study has been, first, to record cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis having occurred in private and public health centres in Ouagadougou from 1996 to 1998 and, second, to determine the progression of the disease in space and time. We wished also to confirm clinical cases in 1998 by parasitological examination, identify different clinical forms of the disease and map out cases in the town. We carried out a retrospective study from 1996 to 1998 and a prospective study in 1998. All cases recorded in this period in visited health centres were included. A total of 1845 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis was identified, 50.3\% of whom concerned women. The age of patients varied between 1 and 79 years for 356 patients, with a mean age of 26.7 years. Cases increased between 1996 and 1998 (1996 = 61 cases, 1997 = 552 cases, 1998 = 1218 cases). The months of highest incidence were August (13\%), September (15\%) and October (17\%). Peripheral districts (28, 30, 29, 16, 15) in south-eastern areas of the town were the worst touched with 87\% of cases. On average, patients seek care after 2 months of progression of the disease. The ulcero-crusted form (68.2\%) was the most frequent clinical form observed for 327 patients, but almost half of the cases had more than one site of infection, (43.5\%). Over half of the patients presented fewer than 10 lesions with an average of 6. The most common locations were on uncovered parts of the body, notably the superior (53\%) and inferior limbs (49\%). The parasite could be tested for by smear on 52 patients only in 1998 and 53.8\% of cases tested were positive. Leishmania major, which is very prevalent in West Africa was identified in one patient. The vectors and main reservoirs of the parasite were not studied. Case management was generally incomplete; the most commonly prescribed drugs were antibiotics (70\% of patients), but self-medication was frequent. Our recommendations after this preliminary study are: undertake multidisciplinary studies on cutaneous leishmaniasis in Ouagadougou in order to understand the local aetiology (vectors responsible for transmission, rodent and domestic animals involved in the epidemiological chain, parasite species); identify all other areas in the country where the disease is highly prevalent provide health care staff with a decisional algorithm and protocol therapy carry out and active control programme for cutaneous leishmaniasis in Burkina Faso.},

  Abstract = {Giant Rat (Cricetomys gambianus Waterh) is a big rodent very common in West Africa. Its burrow is bordering upon huts and lofts in the african villages. Omnivorous, it is more or less a commensal of the man. The blood of 20 adults male and female specimens captured in the Sine Saloum (Fatik) and Presqu'Ille du Cap Vert (Dakar) regions was examined (peripheric blood smears). In 60 p. 100 (12/20) of hemograms, an intraerythrocytic organism of the genus Grahamella Brumpt 1911 was observed. Rod-shaped and carmine-coloured by staining technic of May-Grunwald and Giemsa, it is an unflagellate element. Slightly narrowed in the median part, it is 1 to 1.5 mu long and 0.25 mu wide. Multiplication by bipartition in the red cell plasma that may be occupied by 30 to 40 Grahamella. In chronic infection without morbid signs. 1/50 to 1/60 hematocyte is only infected. Electron micrograph of thin sections of red cells infected by Grahamella shows an element with a cell wall surrounding cytoplasmic masses which are enclosed in a cytoplasmic membrane. Nuclear region (bundles of moniliform chains = nucleic acids) is not surrounded by a nuclear membrane. Intraerythrocytic position. Bipolar densification of the cell plasma. The prokaryote is directly included in the erythrocyte plasma : no host cell vacuole is visible. Stress, polyinfection, polyparasitism or immuno-depressor effects, determine an intense proliferation of Grahamella by micrococcus elements (diameter : 0.1 to 0.3 mu) invading the systemic circulation. In that cases : septicaemia, anaemia; haematopoiesis with respiratory and nervous disorders; hyperthermia and weakness precede the death. This prokaryote is the first Baratonellacae found in the blood of the Giant Rat. It is namded Grahamella knaiae n. sp ("Kania" is the name of C. gambianus in "serere" language of Fatik region of Senegal). The fleas seem to be the vectors or this prokaryotic element.},

  Abstract = {Rodents cause serious adverse effects on farm production due to destruction of food, contamination of feed, and circulation of diseases. The extent of damage or the diseases spread will depend on the type of rodents that invade the farm. This study was conducted in order to find out the species of rodents that infest poultry farms around Mafikeng, North West Province of South Africa. The study was part of a broader project that was investigating Salmonella vectors in the poultry farms around the province. The study trapped 154 rodents from selected farms and used the Cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) and the Cytochrome b (Cyt-b) barcoding genes for species identification. Two rodent pest species, namely, Rattus rattus (the black rat) and Rattus tanezumi (the Asian Rat/Asian House Rat) were identified. A total of 99 (64.3\%) were identified as Rattus rattus and 55 (35.7\%) were Rattus tanezumi. Between the two target genes, Cyt-b gene was only able to identify 40 (25.97\%) of the total samples while COI was more efficient and amplified all the samples and thus was a better target gene for this kind of identification. The two rat species identified are known vectors of serious diseases; thus their presence should be regarded as an indication of high risk for diseases. Despite having been detected in the country before, finding R. tanezumi as the second largest rat species in the area was unexpected since this species is known to be indigenous to Asia.},

Eight male and eight female, non-reproductive individuals were subjected to sir cycles of varying light and temperature regimes. The majority of the individuals displayed daily rhythms o locomotor activity and body temperature that are synchronised to the external light and temperature cycles Furthermore, endogenous rhythms of both locomotor activity and core body temperature were displayed under constant conditions. Thus, we can conclude that C. h mahali possesses a functional circadian clock that car integrate external light and temperature cues into circadian rhythms of locomotor activity and core-body temperature.},

  Abstract = {Rodents and dogs are the confirmed leishmaniases reservoir hosts in Tunisia. Recently, we described hedgehog Leishmania (L.) major and L. infantum infection in an L. infantum endemic area in the North-West. In order to assess if the observation could extend to other endemic areas and to highlight the potential role of hedgehogs as reservoir host, we aimed here at investigating their Leishmania infection in different foci in Tunisia located along a North-South transect, during and outside different transmission seasons. Based on morphological criteria, 2 hedgehogs' species, Atelerix algirus and Paraechinus aethiopicus were identified. Cytologic analysis showed presence of amastigotes in 9/22 samples corresponding to 4 Atelerix algirus specimens. Also, by combining 3 PCR tests targeting repeated DNA fragments using 13A/13B, Lei70R/Lei70L and nested T2/B4-L1/L4 specific primers, all hedgehogs (N = 12) showed a Leishmania infection. The infection rates were very high on spleen (91.66\%), kidney (91.66\%), blood (90.90\%), liver (83.33\%) and eye swabs (100\%). Parasites were also detected in peritoneum. Three hedgehogs were found infected with L. infantum and the only Paraechinus aethiopicus specimen with L. major. A mixed L. major and L. infantum infection was identified in 8 animals, while the last one also had an L. tropica infection. Interestingly, 2 animals had skin lesions infected with L. major while all others appeared asymptomatic. There was a correlation between infected status and epidemiological profiles of the localities. Sequences and phylogeny indicated micro-heterogeneity and lack of correlation with sampling, season, or localities. We confirmed natural infection of Atelerix algirus and originally of Paraechinus aethiopicus in Tunisia. High rate of asymptomatic infection, parasitemia, proximity to transmission cycles, epidemiological patterns of infection together with hedgehogs' abundance, lifespan and lifestyle corroborate the hypothesis they constitute reservoir hosts.},

  Volume = {221},
  Year = {2018},
  Abstract = {The immunocompetence handicap hypothesis (ICHH) proposes that testosterone has both beneficial effects on male reproductive potential and negative effects by suppressing the immune system. However, support for the ICHH has been variable and an alternative hypothesis suggests that testosterone may be acting indirectly via cortisol to suppress immunity (the stress-linked ICHH). A third hypothesis is that increased energetic investment in immunity results in the suppression of testosterone. We tested these hypotheses in male Cape ground squirrels (Xerus inauris) through two separate manipulations: first, by triggering a strong immune response using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection and, secondly, by increasing circulating testosterone using silastic testosterone implants. Responding to an immune challenge significantly reduced testosterone, supporting the immune suppression hypothesis, while increasing circulating testosterone had no effect on immunocompetence, body mass, ectoparasite abundances or cortisol levels, failing to support either the ICHH or stress-linked ICHH. Our results add to the increasing body of literature that challenges the ICHH, and we conclude that the trade-off between testosterone and immunity is mediated through immune activation and not through testosterone in male Cape ground squirrels. Being able to test the ICHH, stress-linked ICHH and immune suppression hypotheses in a free-ranging mammal gives us a unique opportunity to examine the mechanisms mediating this trade-off.},

  Volume = {59},
  Year = {2018},
  Abstract = {Leishmaniasis, a public health problem in Tunisia, are diseases caused by different Leishmania species. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is present from the North to the South under different forms, due to Leishmania (L.) major, L. infantum or L. tropica. Whereas, Psammomys (P.) obesus is the confirmed reservoir host of L. major, those of L. tropica and dermotropic L. infantum wait to be identified. Importantly, P. vexillaris species have been recently highlighted; however, no studies have been carried out to explore its potential role in leishmaniasis epidemiology. Seventy two rodents were collected from Central and South-West of Tunisia between 2007 and 2010. Using several methods, 43 animals were identified as P. obesus and 29 as P. vexillaris. Leishmania kinetoplast DNA was detected in liver samples by real-time PCR in 18 P. obesus and in 8 P. vexillaris. Then, the direct sequencing of the amplified internal transcribed spacer 1, allowed the identification of L. infantum DNA in five P. obesus and in three P. vexillaris, as well as L. tropica DNA in three other P. vexillaris. Whereas, PCR fluorescent fragment length analysis of the 7 spliced leaders, allowed identifying L. major among infected P. obesus and P. vexillaris, and interestingly co-infection (L. major/L. infantum) among two P. obesus. We report here for the first time, the infection of P. obesus, from Central Tunisia, by L. infantum. Suggesting that P. obesus the known reservoir host of L. major, may also serve as reservoir host for L. infantum and thus play a role in the spread of sporadic cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis in this region. Of equal importance, this work establish for the first time, the natural infection of P. vexillaris by different Leishmania species, suggesting its potential epidemiological role as reservoir host.},

  Abstract = {Burrowing mammals are ubiquitous on farms in South Africa and can hinder agricultural practices. This study explored farmer perspectives of these species, and specifically the factors that influence these perspectives. Forty-four farmers responded to a questionnaire that assessed their ecological knowledge of, tolerance towards and lethal management of burrowing mammals that occur on their farms. The results from generalised linear models showed that neither farmer age, nor level of education are accurate predictors of ecological knowledge, overall tolerance towards burrowers, or their lethal management. Knowledge of burrowing mammals showed a significant relationship with tolerance, with more knowledgeable individuals displaying higher levels of tolerance. However, a farmer's overall tolerance towards burrowing species did not affect the number of species managed. Our results also suggest that different values are attached to different species when it comes to lethal management. Thus, farmers commonly controlled the numbers of the problem rodent species, Highveld gerbil (Gerbilliscus brantsii) and Cape ground squirrel (Xerus inauris), but were less likely to manage black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas) and warthog (Phacochoerus africanus), even when experiencing these as problematic. We suggest that the larger, more charismatic species possibly evoke more sympathy from farmers. Agro-ecosystems are likely to become increasingly important for conservation in the future, and we encourage continued studies on the environmental attitudes and approaches of agricultural practitioners as a means to understanding the current status and future trends in ecologically sustainable agriculture.},

  Abstract = {African Grass Rats of the genus Arvicanthis Lesson, 1842, are one of the most important groups of rodents in sub-Saharan Africa. They are abundant in a variety of open habitats, they are major agricultural pests, and they became a popular model in physiological research because of their diurnal activity. Despite this importance, information about their taxonomy and distribution is unsatisfactory, especially in eastern Africa. In this study, we collected the most comprehensive multilocus DNA dataset to date across the geographic and taxonomic range of the genus (229 genotyped specimens from 130 localities in 16 countries belonging to all currently recognized species). We reconstructed phylogenetic relationships, mapped the distribution of major genetic clades, and used the combination of cytogenetic, nuclear, and mitochondrial markers for species delimitations and taxonomic suggestions. The genus is composed of two major evolutionary groups, called here the ANSORGEI and NILOTICUS groups. The former contains four presumed species, while the latter is more diverse and we recognized nine species. Most relationships among species are not resolved, which suggests a rapid radiation (dated to early-middle Pleistocene). Further, there is an indication of reticulate evolution in Ethiopia, that is, the region of the highest Arvicanthis diversity. The distribution of genetic diversity suggests diversification in eastern Africa, followed by repeated dispersals to the west (Sudano-Guinean savannas) and to the south (Masai steppe). We propose nomenclatural changes for Ethiopian taxa and provide suggestions for future steps toward solving remaining taxonomic questions in the genus.},

  Abstract = {Recent reports from Europe and the USA described Seoul orthohantavirus infection in pet rats and their breeders/owners, suggesting the potential emergence of a "new" public health problem. Wild and laboratory rat-induced Seoul infections have, however, been described since the early eighties, due to the omnipresence of the rodent reservoir, the brown rat Rattus norvegicus. Recent studies showed no fundamental differences between the pathogenicity and phylogeny of pet rat-induced Seoul orthohantaviruses and their formerly described wild or laboratory rat counterparts. The paucity of diagnosed Seoul virus-induced disease in the West is in striking contrast to the thousands of cases recorded since the 1980s in the Far East, particularly in China. This review of four continents (Asia, Europe, America, and Africa) puts this "emerging infection" into a historical perspective, concluding there is an urgent need for greater medical awareness of Seoul virus-induced human pathology in many parts of the world. Given the mostly milder and atypical clinical presentation, sometimes even with preserved normal kidney function, the importance of simple but repeated urine examination is stressed, since initial but transient proteinuria and microhematuria are rarely lacking.},

  Abstract = {Southern Africa (South Africa as well as neighboring countries) has not had an infrastructure for testing the safety of new drugs or other therapeutic entities, including plant-based or herbal treatments coming from the indigenous cultures, according to the current practice and regulatory requirements. Simultaneously, Southern Africa is challenged by very high rates of immune deficiency diseases which have further led to the resurgence of diseases such as tuberculosis, which is commonly thought to be eradicated, at least in Western cultures. Thus, there is high medical need for affordable, effective and safe treatments, but up to now there has been no local expertise and capabilities for state-of-the-art drug testing. Based on an initiative funded by the South African Department of Science and Technology, the Potchefstroom campus of North-West University was chosen for the establishment of a center of excellence for doing rodent-based drug testing research. The centerpiece of the Pre-Clinical Drug Development Platform (PCDDP) is a new rodent vivarium for breeding of SPF rats and mice and associated laboratories for conducting a wide range of physiological and pharmacological studies. Notably, the vivarium has become the first AAALAC-accredited animal facility in Sub-Sahara Africa and is qualified for conducting GLP studies. The establishment of safety pharmacology models is a first priority of the PCDDP, including expertise in studies to examine electrophysiological effects in vitro, and potential CNS, cardiovascular and respiratory effects. The intention is to offer the rodent-based safety pharmacology testing not only to local academic and company-related scientists, but also to those throughout South Africa and neighboring countries.},

  Abstract = {Rodents pose a significant threat to human health, particularly in rural subsistence farming communities in Africa, where rodents threaten food security and serve as reservoirs of human pathogens, including the agents of plague, leptospirosis, murine typhus, rat-bite fever, Lassa fever, salmonellosis, and campylobacteriosis. Our study focused on the plague-endemic West Nile region of Uganda, where a majority of residents live in Uganda government-defined poverty, rely on subsistence farming for a living, and frequently experience incursions of rodents into their homes. In this study, we show that rodent removal was achieved in a median of 6 days of intensive lethal trapping with multiple trap types (range: 0-16 days). However, rodent abundance in 68.9\% of homesteads returned to pretreatment levels within a median of 8 weeks (range 1-24 weeks), and at least a single rodent was captured in all homesteads by a median of 2 weeks (range 1-16 weeks) after removal efforts were terminated. Results were similar between homesteads that practiced rodent control whether or not their neighbors implemented similar strategies. Overall, intensive lethal trapping inside homes appears to be effective at reducing rodent abundance, but control was short lived after trapping ceased.},

  Doi = {10.1111/btp.12537},
  Abstract = {While niche separation and relationships with environmental conditions of large mammals of the African savanna have been studied intensively, less conspicuous components have not received similar attention. This is the case of Kafue National Park (KNP), Zambia, where mechanisms supporting coexistence among rodent and shrew species remain unclear, much less the influence of fire on their dietary resource use. Here, we use stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes to assess dietary resource use and partitioning among rodents and shrews found in three vegetation formations of KNP. According to the nitrogen isotope signatures, rodents are one to two trophic levels above primary production, save for Mus triton that is above by two to three. Shrews are two trophic levels above primary production. Among shrews, factors allowing coexistence of similar sized species could not be resolved. Rodent species of the same assemblage either differ in body mass by a factor of two (following Hutchinson's rule) or similar sized species occupy different trophic levels or dietary guilds based on their isotopic nitrogen or carbon signatures. At sites with frequent fires, rodents have broader dietary niches than at sites with low fire frequencies. This could either indicate relaxed competition under high fire frequencies as rodent populations do not reach the carrying capacity of the habitat, or it could reflect reduced competition due to lower species numbers under high versus low fire recurrence regimes. The results indicate competition as an important component structuring rodent communities in Zambian savannas, thus suggesting limited resources.},

  Abstract = {Ten species of rodents were trapped from cocoa groves, abandoned agricultural land and a rice field during the wet season in eastern Sierra Leone. Trap success varied between 0.8\% and 14.1\%. Mean corrected trap success was 6.4\%. Data are analyzed in terms of habitat preferences of individual species, community composition and species richness. Results of dietary analysis are presented. The data indicate that the rodent fauna of cocoa groves contains both savanna-derived and forest-derived elements, though some habitat specialist species were absent. Habitats with a high percentage of understory cover showed a higher rodent species diversity and biomass than those with a sparse understory. The habitats contained 43\% of the predicted small mammal fauna, including 33\% of the forest-dwelling species. Missing species were mostly arboreal forms. Cocoa groves may provide important refugia for forestderived small mammal species in areas where deforestation has been extensive.},
