	abstract = {Leptospirosis essentially affects human following contact with rodent urine-contaminated water. As such, it was mainly found associated with rice culture, recreational activities and flooding. This is also the reason why it has mainly been investigated in temperate as well as warm and humid regions, while arid zones have been only very occasionally monitored for this disease. In particular, data for West African countries are extremely scarce. Here, we took advantage of an extensive survey of urban rodents in Niamey, Niger, in order to look for rodent-borne pathogenic Leptospira species presence and distribution across the city. To do so, we used high throughput bacterial 16S-based metabarcoding, lipL32 gene-targeting RT-PCR, rrs gene sequencing and VNTR typing as well as GIS-based multivariate spatial analysis. Our results show that leptospires seem absent from the core city where usual Leptospira reservoir rodent species (namely R. rattus and M. natalensis) are yet abundant. On the contrary, L. kirschneri was detected in Arvicanthis niloticus and Cricetomys gambianus, two rodent species that are restricted to irrigated cultures within the city. Moreover, the VNTR profiles showed that rodent-borne leptospires in Niamey belong to previously undescribed serovars. Altogether, our study points towards the importance of market gardening in maintain and circulation of leptospirosis within Sahelian cities. In Africa, irrigated urban agriculture constitutes a pivotal source of food supply, especially in the context of the ongoing extensive urbanization of the continent. With this in mind, we speculate that leptospirosis may represent a zoonotic disease of concern also in arid regions that would deserve to be more rigorously surveyed, especially in urban agricultural settings., We surveyed rodent-borne Leptospira in rodents from Niamey, the capital town of Niger, using bacterial metabarcoding, RT-PCR, sequencing, VNTR typing and GIS-based geostatistics. Two new serovars of Leptospira kirschneri were identified in Arvicanthis niloticus and Cricetomys gambianus, two species that inhabit exclusively urban irrigated gardens. Since no rodent-borne leptospires could be found in the core city, our results point towards the importance of urban agriculture in the maintaining and the circulation of these bacteria in cities from semi-arid regions where they are usually poorly documented and even hardly looked for. Accordingly, this is one of the very rare mentions of these zoonotic agents in Sahel, and the first one in Niger. Keeping in mind the critical role of urban gardening for food security in extensively growing West African cities, we believe that leptospirosis should be more closely scrutinized in Sahelian countries where numerous cases of human fevers are of unknown origin.},

Rodents are known as natural reservoirs of the causative Lassa mammarenavirus (LASV) while humans are regarded as incidental, spill-over hosts. Analysis of genetic sequences continues to add to our understanding of the evolutionary history, emergence patterns, and the epidemiology of LASV. Hitherto, the source of data in such investigations has mainly comprised human clinical samples. Presently, a rise in the quantity of virus strains accessed through ecological studies over the last 15 years now allows us to explore how LASV sequences obtained from rodents might affect phylogenetic patterns. In this study, we phylogenetically compared LASV sequences obtained from both rodents and humans across West Africa, including those from two localities highly endemic for the disease: Ekpoma in Nigeria and Kenema in Sierra Leone. We performed a time-calibrated phylogeny, using a Bayesian analysis on 198 taxa, including 102 sequences from rodents and 96 from humans. Contrary to expectation, our results show that LASV strains detected in humans within these localities, even those sampled recently, are consistently ancient to those circulating in rodents in the same area. We discuss the possibilities connected to this preliminary outcome. We also propose modalities to guide more comprehensive comparisons of human and rodent data in LASV molecular epidemiological studies.},

	abstract = {Lassa fever is a rodent-borne disease caused by Lassa virus (LASV). It causes fever, dizziness, vertigo, fatigue, coughing, diarrhea, internal bleeding and facial edema. The disease has been known in Guinea since 1960 but only anectodical acute cases have been reported to date. In January 2019, a 35-year-old man, a wood merchant from Kissidougou, Forest Guinea, presented himself at several health centers with persistent fever, frequent vomiting and joint pain. He was repeatedly treated for severe malaria, and died three weeks later in Mamou regional hospital. Diﬀerential diagnosis identiﬁed LASV as the cause of death. No secondary cases were reported. The complete LASV genome was obtained using next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis showed that this strain, namely the Kissidougou strain, belongs to the clade IV circulating in Guinea and Sierra Leone, and is thought to have emerged some 150 years ago. Due to the similarity of symptoms with malaria, Lassa fever is still a disease that is diﬃcult to recognize and that may remain undiagnosed in health centers in Guinea.},

The reservoir of Lassa virus is the multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis), a highly commensal species in West Africa. Primary transmission to humans occurs through direct or indirect contact with rodent body fluids such as urine, feces, saliva, or blood. Our research draws together qualitative and quantitative methods to provide a fuller and more nuanced perspective on these varied points of human-animal contact. In this article, we focus on the hunting, preparation, and consumption of rodents as possible routes of exposure in Bo, Sierra Leone. We found that the consumption of rodents, including the reservoir species, is widespread and does not neatly tally against generational or gender lines. Further, we found that the reasons for rodent consumption are multifactorial, including taste preferences, food security, and opportunistic behavior. We argue that on certain topics, such as rodent consumption, establishing trust with communities, and using qualitative research methods, is key to investigate sensitive issues and situate them in their wider context. To conclude, we recommend ways to refine sensitization campaigns to account for these socio-cultural contexts.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic illness responsible for disease outbreaks across West Africa. It is a zoonosis, with the primary reservoir species identified as the Natal multimammate mouse, Mastomys natalensis. The host is distributed across sub-Saharan Africa while the virus' range appears to be restricted to West Africa. The majority of infections result from interactions between the animal reservoir and human populations, although secondary transmission between humans can occur, particularly in hospital settings.
METHODS: Using a species distribution model, the locations of confirmed human and animal infections with Lassa virus (LASV) were used to generate a probabilistic surface of zoonotic transmission potential across sub-Saharan Africa.
RESULTS: Our results predict that 37.7 million people in 14 countries, across much of West Africa, live in areas where conditions are suitable for zoonotic transmission of LASV. Four of these countries, where at-risk populations are predicted, have yet to report any cases of Lassa fever.
CONCLUSIONS: These maps act as a spatial guide for future surveillance activities to better characterise the geographical distribution of the disease and understand the anthropological, virological and zoological interactions necessary for viral transmission. Combining this zoonotic niche map with detailed patient travel histories can aid differential diagnoses of febrile illnesses, enabling a more rapid response in providing care and reducing the risk of onward transmission.},

Zoonotic transmission occurs when humans are directly or indirectly exposed to fluids of the multimammate mouse, such as urine, saliva, and blood. Housing characteristics and domestic organization affect rodent density in and around households and villages, and are likely to be a risk factor for Lassa fever in humans where the reservoir exists. We use semi-structured interviews (N = 51), a quantitative survey (N = 429), direct observations, and a rodent ecology study to provide new insights into how the organization of domestic spaces brings together humans and rodents and creates pathways for infection in rural settlements in Bo District, Sierra Leone. Rodents were frequently reported inside houses (92.4\% of respondents), in which we predominantly trapped M. natalensis (57\% of trapped rodents) and Rattus rattus (38\% of trapped rodents). Building design and materials provide hiding and nesting places for rodents and lead to close proximity with humans. Patterns of contact are both unintentional and intentional and research participants reported high levels of contact with rodents (34.2\% of respondents) and rodent fluids (52.8\% of respondents). Rodents are also perceived as a serious threat to food security. These results present detailed knowledge about how humans live with and come into contact with rodents, including the LASV reservoir. Our results argue for further collaborative research in housing and environmental modification such as ceiling construction, food storage, and sanitation as prevention against zoonotic LASV transmission.},

	abstract = {As part of a large survey on reservoirs of Lassa fever in Guinea, three villages were investigated in high endemic zone, close to Sierra Leone border. Biodiversity of the small mammal community is presented in this study through a standardized trapping in houses, cultivations and forest. Identification of the small mammals was based on morphology and by molecular technique for sibling species. Of the 1123 specimens collected in 2003–2005, we identified seventeen species (thirteen Muridae, four Soricidae), leading to high diversity (Shannon index = 1.6–1.8) and high equitability (evenness index = 0.7–0.8) in cultivations and forest. In houses conversely, the rodent community was dominated by Mastomys natalensis (95–98\%), leading to low diversity and equitability. Dynamics and reproduction were investigated in two species of pygmy mice, Mus mattheyi and Mus minutoides, two species of Praomys, P. daltoni and P. rostratus, and in Mastomys erythroleucus. The pygmy mice were abundant in cultivations in early rainy season, and reproduced from rainy to dry season. Praomys daltoni was also found more abundant in cultivations and seemed to reproduce between rainy and dry season, whereas P. rostratus preferred forest and cultivations in late rainy season, and reproduced throughout the year. Finally, M. erythroleucus was more abundant in forest in dry season, and seemed to reproduce from late rainy to dry season. This species had a low occurrence (6.5\%) in the Faranah’s zone, and probably lived at its southern limit in Guinea. The presence of other Murinae, such as M. natalensis, Praomys spp as possible competitors in the same habitats, is discussed. For the first time, this study relates population biology of pygmy mice with molecular identification.},

	abstract = {We recently reported increased prevalence of Lassa virus (LASV) infection in Mastomys natalensis during the rainy season in Guinea, West Africa. Here, the association of LASV prevalence with fecundity, fertility, and the age structure of the rodent population was analyzed using data from the previous study. The animals reproduced throughout the year, but highest fecundity was observed during the rainy season. Accordingly, the rodent population was aged at the beginning and young at the end of the rainy season. Lassa virus infection was observed in all age groups, including the very young, which is compatible with vertical transmission. However, since the prevalence of infection showed a trend with increasing age in the younger age groups, horizontal transmission by yet unknown mechanisms may also play a role in LASV transmission. Multivariate analysis did not show an association of LASV prevalence with any demographic variable studied. Rodent behavior influencing virus transmissibility and contaminated environment may therefore be responsible for spatial and seasonal variations in LASV prevalence in M. natalensis.},

	abstract = {Based on empiric surveillance data, the incidence of human Lassa fever (LF) cases in Guinea and other West African countries has been reported to increase during the dry season compared to the rainy season. To investigate possible links with the ecology of the rodent reservoir of the virus, we conducted a 2-year longitudinal survey of Mastomys natalensis in a region of high human Lassa virus (LASV) seropositivity in Guinea. Standardized rodent trapping with similar trapping efforts between seasons was performed in three villages and 53.5\% (601/1123) of the animals were identified as M. natalensis using morphometric and molecular criteria. Mean trapping success (TS) of M. natalensis was always higher inside houses than in proximal cultivations. In the dry season, mean TS increased 2-fold inside houses and decreased up to 10-fold outside (p {\textless} 0.0001), suggesting aggregation of rodents inside houses due to restricted food supply. 14.5\% (80/553) of M. natalensis were tested positive for Lassa virus by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR; range, 5\%-30\%) and prevalence of the virus was two to three times higher in rodents captured in the rainy season than in the dry season (p {\textless} 0.05). Inside houses, however, the LASV prevalence fluctuated nonsignificantly with season. These data suggest that in Guinea the risk of LASV transmission from rodents to humans is present both in the rainy and the dry season, reflected by the occurrence of LF cases throughout the year. In the dry season, however, the increased risk of humans encountering Mastomys and their excreta inside of houses may result in an increase of human Lassa fever cases.},

To this end, we generated 132 partial nucleoprotein sequences of LASV from M. natalensis trapped in 12 villages around Faranah, Upper Guinea, over a period of 12 years. This study reveals two main features of LASV evolution in M. natalensis. First, the virus evolves in the reservoir with a molecular clock rate of 9 (7-11) × 10(-4) position(-1) year(-1) implying that contemporary LASV lineages circulate in the Faranah area since less than 100 years. Second, viruses circulating in a specific village are diverse and polyphyletic. We observed, however, there are monophyletic clusters at village and sub-village level at specific points in time. In conclusion, our data indicate that the temporal and spatial pattern of LASV evolution in the natural reservoir is characterized by a combination of stationary circulation within a village and virus movement between villages. The latter feature is relevant for rodent control strategies, as it implies that recurrence of the virus from neighbouring villages may occur in villages where the virus has previously been eradicated.},

	abstract = {Background Lassa fever is caused by a viral haemorrhagic arenavirus that affects two to three million people in West Africa, causing a mortality of between 5,000 and 10,000 each year. The natural reservoir of Lassa virus is the multi-mammate rat Mastomys natalensis, which lives in houses and surrounding fields. With the aim of gaining more information to control this disease, we here carry out a spatial analysis of Lassa fever data from human cases and infected rodent hosts covering the period 1965–2007. Information on contemporary environmental conditions (temperature, rainfall, vegetation) was derived from NASA Terra MODIS satellite sensor data and other sources and for elevation from the GTOPO30 surface for the region from Senegal to the Congo. All multi-temporal data were analysed using temporal Fourier techniques to generate images of means, amplitudes and phases which were used as the predictor variables in the models. In addition, meteorological rainfall data collected between 1951 and 1989 were used to generate a synoptic rainfall surface for the same region. Methodology/Principal Findings Three different analyses (models) are presented, one superimposing Lassa fever outbreaks on the mean rainfall surface (Model 1) and the other two using non-linear discriminant analytical techniques. Model 2 selected variables in a step-wise inclusive fashion, and Model 3 used an information-theoretic approach in which many different random combinations of 10 variables were fitted to the Lassa fever data. Three combinations of absence∶presence clusters were used in each of Models 2 and 3, the 2 absence∶1 presence cluster combination giving what appeared to be the best result. Model 1 showed that the recorded outbreaks of Lassa fever in human populations occurred in zones receiving between 1,500 and 3,000 mm rainfall annually. Rainfall, and to a much lesser extent temperature variables, were most strongly selected in both Models 2 and 3, and neither vegetation nor altitude seemed particularly important. Both Models 2 and 3 produced mean kappa values in excess of 0.91 (Model 2) or 0.86 (Model 3), making them ‘Excellent’. Conclusion/Significance The Lassa fever areas predicted by the models cover approximately 80\% of each of Sierra Leone and Liberia, 50\% of Guinea, 40\% of Nigeria, 30\% of each of Côte d'Ivoire, Togo and Benin, and 10\% of Ghana.},

However, our knowledge of LF ecology, epidemiology and distribution is limited, which presents barriers to both short-term disease forecasting and prediction of long-term impacts of environmental change on Lassa virus (LASV) zoonotic transmission dynamics. Here, we synthesize current knowledge to show that extrapolations from past research have produced an incomplete picture of the incidence and distribution of LF, with negative consequences for policy planning, medical treatment and management interventions. Although the recent increase in LF case reports is likely due to improved surveillance, recent studies suggest that future socio-ecological changes in West Africa may drive increases in LF burden. Future research should focus on the geographical distribution and disease burden of LF, in order to improve its integration into public policy and disease control strategies.},

Here, we describe a novel arenavirus in M. natalensis from Gairo district of central Tanzania, for which we propose the name "Gairo virus". Surprisingly, the virus is not closely related with Morogoro virus that infects M. natalensis only 90km south of Gairo, but clusters phylogenetically with Mobala-like viruses that infect non-M. natalensis host species in Central African Republic and Ethiopia. Despite the evolutionary distance, Gairo virus shares basic ecological features with the other M. natalensis-borne viruses Lassa and Morogoro. Our data show that M. natalensis, carrying distantly related viruses even in the same geographical area, is a potent reservoir host for a variety of arenaviruses.},

	abstract = {Environmental changes have been shown to play an important role in the emergence of new human diseases of zoonotic origin. The contribution of social factors to their spread, especially conflicts followed by mass movement of populations, has not been extensively investigated. Here we reveal the effects of civil war on the phylogeography of a zoonotic emerging infectious disease by concomitantly studying the population structure, evolution and demography of Lassa virus and its natural reservoir, the rodent Mastomys natalensis, in Guinea, West Africa. Analysis of nucleoprotein gene sequences enabled us to reconstruct the evolutionary history of Lassa virus, which appeared 750 to 900 years ago in Nigeria and only recently spread across western Africa (170 years ago). Bayesian demographic inferences revealed that both the host and the virus populations have gone recently through severe genetic bottlenecks. The timing of these events matches civil war-related mass movements of refugees and accompanying environmental degradation. Forest and habitat destruction and human predation of the natural reservoir are likely explanations for the sharp decline observed in the rodent populations, the consequent virus population decline, and the coincident increased incidence of Lassa fever in these regions. Interestingly, we were also able to detect a similar pattern in Nigeria coinciding with the Biafra war. Our findings show that anthropogenic factors may profoundly impact the population genetics of a virus and its reservoir within the context of an emerging infectious disease.},

	abstract = {The Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis) is the reservoir host of Lassa virus (LASV), an arenavirus that causes Lassa haemorrhagic fever in humans in West Africa. While previous studies suggest that spillover risk is focal within rural villages due to the spatial behaviour of the rodents, the level of clustering was never specifically assessed. Nevertheless, detailed information on the spatial distribution of infected rodents would be highly valuable to optimize LASV-control campaigns, which are limited to rodent control or interrupting human–rodent contact considering that a human vaccine is not available. Here, we analysed data from a four-year field experiment to investigate whether LASV-infected rodents cluster in households in six rural villages in Guinea. Our analyses were based on the infection status (antibody or PCR) and geolocation of rodents (n = 864), and complemented with a phylogenetic analysis of LASV sequences (n = 119). We observed that the majority of infected rodents were trapped in a few houses (20\%) and most houses were rodent-free at a specific point in time (60\%). We also found that LASV strains circulating in a specific village were polyphyletic with respect to neighbouring villages, although most strains grouped together at the sub-village level and persisted over time. In conclusion, our results suggest that: (i) LASV spillover risk is heterogeneously distributed within villages in Guinea; (ii) viral elimination in one particular village is unlikely if rodents are not controlled in neighbouring villages. Such spatial information should be incorporated into eco-epidemiological models that assess the cost-efficiency of LASV control strategies.},

	abstract = {Lassa fever is an acute viral zoonotic illness caused by Lassa virus, an arenavirus known to be responsible for a severe haemorrhagic fever characterised by fever, muscle aches, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and, chest and abdominal pain. The virus exhibits persistent, asymptomatic infection with profuse urinary virus excretion in the ubiquitous rodent vector, Mastomys natalensis. Lassa fever is endemic in West Africa and has been reported from Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Nigeria. Some studies indicate that 300,000 to 500,000 cases of Lassa fever and 5000 deaths occur yearly across West Africa. Studies reported in English, that investigated Lassa fever with reference to West Africa were identified using the Medline Entrez-PubMed search and were used for this review. The scarcity of resources available for health care delivery system and the political instability that characterise the West African countries would continue to impede efforts for the control of Lassa fever in the sub-region. There is need for adequate training of health care workers regarding diagnostics, intensive care of patients under isolation, contact tracing, adequate precautionary measures in handling infectious laboratory specimens, control of the vector as well as care and disposal of infectious waste.},

	abstract = {Lassa virus (LASV) causes a deadly haemorrhagic fever in humans, killing several thousand people in West Africa annually. For 40 years, the Natal multimammate rat, Mastomys natalensis, has been assumed to be the sole host of LASV. We found evidence that LASV is also hosted by other rodent species: the African wood mouse Hylomyscus pamfi in Nigeria, and the Guinea multimammate mouse Mastomys erythroleucus in both Nigeria and Guinea. Virus strains from these animals were isolated in the BSL-4 laboratory and fully sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses of viral genes coding for glycoprotein, nucleoprotein, polymerase and matrix protein show that Lassa strains detected in M. erythroleucus belong to lineages III and IV. The strain from H. pamfi clusters close to lineage I (for S gene) and between II \& III (for L gene). Discovery of new rodent hosts has implications for LASV evolution and its spread into new areas within West Africa.},

	abstract = {Nigeria has a rich small mammal community, with several species implicated as carriers of zoonotic microbes such as the Lassa virus (LASV). We sought to elucidate the diversity and distribution of these animals (including known LASV reservoirs) geographically, habitat-wise and seasonally. Our DNA-assisted survey detected at least 19 small mammal species amongst 790 specimens. Diversity indices were similar between ecological zones and also between endemic and non-endemic areas for Lassa fever. Mastomys natalensis, the most renowned LASV host, was present in eight out of nine localities sampled. We also described the spatial occurrence of other known LASV hosts such as M. erythroleucus and Hylomyscus pamfi, including carriers of LASV-like arenaviruses such as Mus (Nannomys) spp. The most numerous rodents (Mastomys natalensis, M. erythroleucus, and Praomys daltoni) were captured mainly inside human dwellings. Reproductive activity occurred throughout the year, but led to population peaks for M. natalensis in the dry season and for M. erythroleucus and P. daltoni in the rainy season. Extensive geographic distribution of LASV rodent reservoirs, with population peaks in different seasons, shows that the risk of rodent-to-human transmission of LASV is greater than currently realized.},

	abstract = {Background Lassa fever is an acute viral illness characterized by multi-organ failure and hemorrhagic manifestations. Lassa fever is most frequently diagnosed in Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea, although sporadic cases have been recorded in other West African countries, including Mali. The etiological agent of Lassa fever is Lassa virus (LASV), an Arenavirus which is maintained in nature and frequently transmitted to humans by Mastomys natalensis. The purpose of this study was to better define the geographic distribution of LASV-infected rodents in sub-Saharan Mali. Methodologies/Principal Findings Small mammals were live-trapped at various locations across Mali for the purpose of identifying potential zoonotic pathogens. Serological and molecular assays were employed and determined LASV infected rodents were exclusively found in the southern Mali near the border of Côte d'Ivoire. Overall, 19.4\% of Mastomys natalensis sampled in this region had evidence of LASV infection, with prevalence rates for individual villages ranging from 0 to 52\%. Full-length genomic sequences were determined using high throughput sequencing methodologies for LASV isolates generated from tissue samples of rodents collected in four villages and confirmed the phylogenetic clustering of Malian LASV with strain AV. Conclusions/Significance The risk of human infections with LASV is greatest in villages in southern Mali. Lassa fever should be considered in the differential diagnosis for febrile individuals and appropriate diagnostic techniques need to be established to determine the incidence of infection and disease in these regions.},

Despite increased awareness, to date only a single case of Lassa fever has been confirmed in Mali. We conducted a survey to determine the prevalence of LASV exposure among persons in 3 villages in southern Mali where the presence of infected rodents has been documented. LASV IgG seroprevalence ranged from 14.5\% to 44\% per village. No sex bias was noted; however, seropositivity rates increased with participant age.

	abstract = {We evaluated the impact of man-made conflict events and climate change impact in guiding evidence-based community "One Health" epidemiology and emergency response practice against re-/emerging epidemics. Increasing evidence of emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases including recent Lassa fever outbreaks in almost 20 states in Nigeria led to 101 deaths and 175 suspected and confirmed cases since August 2015. Of the 75 laboratory confirmed cases, 90 deaths occurred representing 120\% laboratory-confirmed case fatality. The outbreak has been imported into neighbouring country such as Benin, where 23 deaths out of 68 cases has also been reported. This study assesses the current trends in re-emerging Lassa fever outbreak in understanding spatio-geographical reservoir(s), risk factors pattern and Lassa virus incidence mapping, inherent gaps and raising challenges in health systems. It is shown that Lassa fever peak endemicity incidence and prevalence overlap the dry season (within January to March) and reduced during the wet season (of May to November) annually in Sierra Leone, Senegal to Eastern Nigeria. We documented a scarcity of consistent data on rodent (reservoirs)-linked Lassa fever outbreak, weak culturally and socio-behavioural effective prevention and control measures integration, weak or limited community knowledge and awareness to inadequate preparedness capacity and access to affordable case management in affected countries. Hence, robust sub/regional leadership commitment and investment in Lassa fever is urgently needed in building integrated and effective community "One Health" surveillance and rapid response approach practice coupled with pest management and phytosanitation measures against Lassa fever epidemic. This offers new opportunities in understanding human-animal interactions in strengthening Lassa fever outbreak early detection and surveillance, warning alerts and rapid response implementation in vulnerable settings. Leveraging on Africa CDC centre, advances in cloud-sourcing and social media tools and solutions is core in developing and integrating evidence-based and timely risk communication, and reporting systems in improving contextual community-based immunization and control decision making policy to effectively defeat Lassa fever outbreak and other emerging pandemics public health emergencies in Africa and worldwide.},

Eight Lassa virus strains were isolated from tissues and blood of rodents identified in the field as being of 3 different species: Mastomys natalensis, Rattus rattus, and Mus minutoides. All the infected rodents were collected in village habitats. These isolations indicate the presence of Lassa virus in wild rodents in Nigeria during periods when no human infections were evident., Prior studies in Sierra Leone have indicated that a single rodent species, M. natalensis, may be the important reservoir host of Lassa virus. Since the present study indicates that other rodent species may be involved as well, the ecology of Lassa virus may be more complicated than was heretofore supposed. In view of the importance of determining the geographic and species range of rodent hosts of Lassa virus, and because of the problems inherent in rodent identification under austere field conditions, it is urgent that further studies be conducted in the same areas of Nigeria to confirm these findings.},

	abstract = {Accurate data on the Lassa virus (LASV) human case fatality rate (CFR) and the prevalence of LASV in humans, rodents and other mammals are needed for better planning of actions that will ultimately reduce the burden of LASV infection in sub-Saharan Africa. In this systematic review with meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Scopus, Africa Journal Online, and African Index Medicus from 1969 to 2020 to obtain studies that reported enough data to calculate LASV infection CFR or prevalence. Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently. We extracted all measures of current, recent, and past infections with LASV. Prevalence and CFR estimates were pooled using a random-effect meta-analysis. Factors associated with CFR, prevalence, and sources of between-study heterogeneity were determined using subgroup and metaregression analyses. This review was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020166465. We initially identified 1,399 records and finally retained 109 reports that contributed to 291 prevalence records from 25 countries. The overall CFR was 29.7\% (22.3–37.5) in humans. Pooled prevalence of LASV infection was 8.7\% (95\% confidence interval: 6.8–10.8) in humans, 3.2\% (1.9–4.6) in rodents, and 0.7\% (0.0–2.3) in other mammals. Subgroup and metaregression analyses revealed a substantial statistical heterogeneity explained by higher prevalence in tissue organs, in case-control, in hospital outbreak, and surveys, in retrospective studies, in urban and hospital setting, in hospitalized patients, and in West African countries. This study suggests that LASV infections is an important cause of death in humans and that LASV are common in humans, rodents and other mammals in sub-Saharan Africa. These estimates highlight disparities between sub-regions, and population risk profiles. Western Africa, and specific key populations were identified as having higher LASV CFR and prevalence, hence, deserving more attention for cost-effective preventive interventions.},

Using three types of break-back traps 1169 small rodents were caught, the commonest species being Praomys tullbergi (487 specimens) with Lophuromys sikapusi second (281 specimens). The remaining 401 specimens comprised twelve species. Weights, measurements and reproductive details were taken of each specimen. The distribution of larger rodents not caught in traps, but exposed as a result of bulldozed clearance of their habitat is discussed. The removal of high forest and its replacement by agriculture and domestic housing increased the numbers, biomass and diversity of small rodents. Seasonal changes in trap success were noted, but the patterns differed from one habitat to another. In general, more rodents were trapped during the rains of the second quarter than during the dry months of the first quarter of the year. Seasonal changes in the breeding of two rodent species were also noted although they differed from each other, and speculations on the reasons why the rodent population varied from habitat to habitat are discussed.},

	abstract = {Lassa fever, also known as Lassa hemorrhagic fever, is a virus that has generated recurrent outbreaks in West Africa. We use mechanistic modelling to study the Lassa fever epidemics in Nigeria from 2016-19. Our model describes the interaction between human and rodent populations with the consideration of quarantine, isolation and hospitalization processes. Our model supports the phenomenon of forward bifurcation where the stability between disease-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium exchanges. Moreover, our model captures well the incidence curves from surveillance data. In particular, our model is able to reconstruct the periodic rodent and human forces of infection. Furthermore, we suggest that the three major epidemics from 2016-19 can be modelled by properly characterizing the rodent (or human) force of infection while the estimated human force of infection also present similar patterns across outbreaks. Our results suggest that the initial susceptibility likely increased across the three outbreaks from 2016-19. Our results highlight the similarity of the transmission dynamics driving three major Lassa fever outbreaks in the endemic areas.},

	abstract = {Lassa virus is a significant burden on human health throughout its endemic region in West Africa, with most human infections the result of spillover from the primary rodent reservoir of the virus, the natal multimammate mouse, M. natalensis. Here we develop a Bayesian methodology for estimating epidemiological parameters of Lassa virus within its rodent reservoir and for generating probabilistic predictions for the efficacy of rodent vaccination programs. Our approach uses Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to integrate mechanistic mathematical models, remotely-sensed precipitation data, and Lassa virus surveillance data from rodent populations. Using simulated data, we show that our method accurately estimates key model parameters, even when surveillance data are available from only a relatively small number of points in space and time. Applying our method to previously published data from two villages in Guinea estimates the time-averaged R0 of Lassa virus to be 1.74 and 1.54 for rodent populations in the villages of Bantou and Tanganya, respectively. Using the posterior distribution for model parameters derived from these Guinean populations, we evaluate the likely efficacy of vaccination programs relying on distribution of vaccine-laced baits. Our results demonstrate that effective and durable reductions in the risk of Lassa virus spillover into the human population will require repeated distribution of large quantities of vaccine.},

Arenaviruses are pleomorphic enveloped particles that contain two RNA segments of virus origin and ribosome-like components. Suitable conditions for transmission of virus to humans occur in areas where humans come in contact with rodent urine that contains virus. Persistent viremia and viruria in rodents result from a slow or insufficient immune response when immunologically immature fetuses or neonates are infected. In humans, the disease is acute. There are five pathogens of humans, who are only accidental hosts. Four cause severe hemorrhagic fever with a mortality of about 15 percent among hospitalized patients in circumscribed areas (Lassa virus in West Africa, Junin virus in the Argentine pampas, Machupo virus in Bolivia, and Guanarito virus in Venezuela). The fifth, lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus, is much more widely distributed, but causes milder infections, often neurologic.

Though a rodent-borne infection, it can also be transmitted from person to person during the care of sick relations or more commonly in health care settings as a nosocomial infection. Vertical transmission from mother to child has been documented. We report 2 cases of LF among pregnant women which were managed at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, between September and October 2014. Both patients were in their early 20s with only one surviving the disease. Both had supportive therapy but none had antiviral therapy. This report emphasized the importance of early presentation, high index of suspicion, prompt diagnosis, and early commencement of supportive therapy in the management of patients suspected with LF especially in the era of other viral haemorrhagic infections.},

	abstract = {Arenaviruses are rodent-borne emerging human pathogens. Diseases caused by these viruses, e.g., Lassa fever (LF) in West Africa and South American hemorrhagic fevers (HFs), are serious public health problems in endemic areas. We have employed replication-competent and replication-deficient strategies to design vaccine candidates potentially targeting different groups "at risk". Our leader LF vaccine candidate, the live reassortant vaccine ML29, is safe and efficacious in all tested animal models including non-human primates. In this study we showed that treatment of fatally infected animals with ML29 two days after Lassa virus (LASV) challenge protected 80\% of the treated animals. In endemic areas, where most of the target population is poor and many live far from health care facilities, a single-dose vaccination with ML29 would be ideal solution. Once there is an outbreak, a fast-acting vaccine or post-exposure prophylaxis would be best. The 2(nd) vaccine technology is based on Yellow Fever (YF) 17D vaccine. We designed YF17D-based recombinant viruses expressing LASV glycoproteins (GP) and showed protective efficacy of these recombinants. In the current study we developed a novel technology to clone LASV nucleocapsid within YF17D C gene. Low immunogenicity and stability of foreign inserts must be addressed to design successful LASV/YFV bivalent vaccines to control LF and YF in overlapping endemic areas of West Africa. The 3(rd) platform is based on the new generation of alphavirus replicon virus-like-particle vectors (VLPV). Using this technology we designed VLPV expressing LASV GP with enhanced immunogenicity and bivalent VLPV expressing cross-reactive GP of Junin virus (JUNV) and Machupo virus (MACV), causative agents of Argentinian and Bolivian HF, respectively. A prime-boost regimen required for VLPV immunization might be practical for medical providers, military, lab personnel, and visitors in endemic areas.},

We conducted a prospective study to detect L. major in rodents, animals which are described as reservoir of the parasite. Rodents were caught in five city areas from November 2005 to October 2006. Giemsa stained smears were realized from the cutaneous lesions when present after macroscopic examination of external lesions. The spleen of each rodent was sterilely removed and split into 3 parts for microscopic examination of smears, culture on NNN media and PCR, respectively. A total of 101 rodents belonging to 9 genera were trapped. All the direct examinations and cultures were negative. By using PCR of lesions and spleen samples, three animals were found infected by L. major: one out of 24 (4.2\%) Mastomys natalensis; one out of 8 (12.5\%) Taterillus sp. and one out of three Cricetomys gambianus. This is the first detection of L. major in rodent species in Burkina Faso. Further studies are needed to confirm their role as reservoirs of L. major.},

In addition to present efforts to raise awareness, school children can be targeted to become peer and family health educators. The study was carried out to determine the knowledge of Lassa fever among secondary school children, and household practices that increase risk of the infection., STUDY DESIGN: In a cross sectional survey, 561 secondary school students randomly selected from schools in Edo State were interviewed by means of a self - administered questionnaire that sought information on knowledge of Lassa fever and practices within the home that favour rodent contact . Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 15., RESULTS: Knowledge of Lassa fever was poor among 259 (49.4\%) respondents, fair in 216 (41.2\%) and good in 49 (9.4\%). Female gender ({\textless} 0.01), monogamous family structure (p {\textless} 0.04) , and being in senior secondary class ( p=0.01) were predictors of high knowledge score. Self- reported Lassa fever risk conditions were found to be of low prevalence in 311(55.4\%) and high in 250 (44.6\%) homes, and associated with educational status of mother ( p=0.00) and father, (p =0.00)., CONCLUSION: School children in endemic communities lack good knowledge of Lassa fever, but when properly guided, have the potential to become peer and family educators.},

	abstract = {As Lassa fever continues to be a public health challenge in West Africa, it is critical to produce good maps of its risk pattern for use in active surveillance and control intervention. We identified eight spatial features related to the rubber plantation environment and used them as explanatory variables for Lassa fever (LF) outbreaks on the Uniroyal Liberian Agricultural Company (LAC) rubber plantation environment in Grand Bassa County, Liberia. We computed classical and spatial lag regression models on all spatial features, including proximity of residential camp to rubber tree-edge, main road in the plantation, LAC hospital, rice farmland, household refuse dump, human population density, post-harvest storage density of rice and density of rodent deterrent on rice storage. We found significant (p=0.0024) spatial autocorrelation between LF cases and the spatial features we have considered. We concluded that the rubber plantation environment influenced Mastomys species' breeding and transmission of Lassa virus along spatial scale to humans. The risk factors identified in this study offered a baseline for more effective surveillance and control of LF in the post-civil conflict Liberia. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

After having collected molecular evidence of an indigenous African hantavirus in 2006, an intensive investigation for new hantaviruses has been started in small mammals. Various novel hantaviruses have been molecularly identified not only in rodents but also in shrews and bats. In addition, the first African hantavirus, Sangassou virus, has been isolated and functionally characterized in cell culture. Less is known about the ability of these hantaviruses to infect humans and to cause diseases. To date, no hantavirus genetic material could be amplified from patients' specimens collected in Africa. Serological studies in West Africa, based on a battery of screening and confirmatory assays, led to the detection of hantavirus antibodies in the human population and in patients with putative hantavirus disease. In addition to this overview, we present original data from seroepidemiological and field studies conducted in the Southern part of Africa. A human seroprevalence rate of 1.0\% (n=1442) was detected in the South African Cape Region whereas no molecular evidence for the presence of hantavirus was found in 2500 small animals trapped in South Africa and Namibia.

Four main vector / pathogen complexes are classically recognized, with the louse Pediculus humanus acting as vector for B. recurrentis and the soft ticks Ornithodoros sonrai, O. erraticus and O. moubata acting as vectors for Borrelia crocidurae, B. hispanica and B. duttonii, respectively. Our aim was to investigate the epidemiology of the disease in West, North and Central Africa., METHODS AND FINDINGS: From 2002 to 2012, we conducted field surveys in 17 African countries and in Spain. We investigated the occurrence of Ornithodoros ticks in rodent burrows in 282 study sites. We collected 1,629 small mammals that may act as reservoir for Borrelia infections. Using molecular methods we studied genetic diversity among Ornithodoros ticks and Borrelia infections in ticks and small mammals. Of 9,870 burrows investigated, 1,196 (12.1\%) were inhabited by Ornithodoros ticks. In West Africa, the southern and eastern limits of the vectors and Borrelia infections in ticks and small mammals were 13degreeN and 01degreeE, respectively. Molecular studies revealed the occurrence of nine different Ornithodoros species, including five species new for science, with six of them harboring Borrelia infections. Only B. crocidurae was found in West Africa and three Borrelia species were identified in North Africa: B. crocidurae, B. hispanica, and B. merionesi., CONCLUSIONS: Borrelia Spirochetes responsible for relapsing fever in humans are highly prevalent both in Ornithodoros ticks and small mammals in North and West Africa but Ornithodoros ticks seem absent south of 13degreeN and small mammals are not infected in these regions. The number of Ornithodoros species acting as vector of relapsing fever is much higher than previously known.},

The virus was isolated from an African wood mouse (Hylomyscus simus), trapped in a forest habitat in Guinea, West Africa. Here, we report on the characterization of the genetic and functional properties of the virus. The complete genome of SANGV was determined and showed typical hantavirus organization. The small (S), medium (M), and large (L) genome segments containing genes encoding nucleocapsid protein, two envelope glycoproteins, and viral polymerase were found to be 1,746, 3,650, and 6,531 nucleotides long, respectively. The exact 5' and 3' termini for all three segments of the SANGV genome were determined and were predicted to form the panhandle structures typical of bunyaviruses. Phylogenetic analyses of all three segment sequences confirmed SANGV as a Murinae-associated hantavirus most closely related to the European Dobrava-Belgrade virus. We showed, however, that SANGV uses beta(1) integrin rather than beta(3) integrin and decay-accelerating factor (DAF)/CD55 as an entry receptor. In addition, we demonstrated a strong induction of type III lambda interferon (IFN-lambda) expression in type I IFN-deficient Vero E6 cells by SANGV. These properties are unique within Murinae-associated hantaviruses and make the virus useful in comparative studies focusing on hantavirus pathogenesis.},

	abstract = {Lassa fever remains a serious challenge to public health in West Africa threatening both local residents in rural areas and those who serve them, particularly medical care providers. Given the ecology of the rodent host and conditions in the endemic area, a vaccine is mandatory for control. The challenge is to overcome the scientific, political and economic obstacles to producing a human use vaccine candidate. There are some scientific issues to resolve. It is known that the G-protein confers protection but we do not know its duration. If the N-protein is also included there may be a better duration of protection but it is unclear whether the N-protein as a vaccine may possibly enhance the infection. The original vaccinia vector must be replaced by new vectors, chimeras or by delivering DNA in some format. A live vaccine is attractive because it can confer protection in a single shot. A killed vaccine is more stable, particularly for distribution in the tropics but usually requires repeated shots. For practical reasons a live vaccine format should probably be pursued, which could then be combined with a yellow fever vaccine, using the same cold chains, since this disease occupies the same endemic areas in West Africa. Lassa vaccine initiatives have suffered from a lack of funding in the past but bioterrorism has brought new resources to Lassa virus science. Adequate funding and applications of new vaccine technologies give hope that we may soon see a vaccine in clinical trials. However, the difficulty of conducting trials in endemic areas and lack of political stability remain serious problems.},

We have carried out a case control study in children living in an endemic region of West Africa to reveal associations between PfTRAP seroprevalence and the risk of cerebral malaria. Sera collected from the case and control groups were analysed by ELISA to compare their serum reactivity against PfTRAP, the circumsporozoite protein and the merozoite surface protein 1. Children with uncomplicated malaria had a significantly higher PfTRAP seroprevalence when compared to children with cerebral malaria. The risk of developing cerebral malaria appeared to depend on the reciprocal relationship between sporozoite inoculation rates and humoral immunity against PfTRAP. Our results suggest that naturally induced humoral immunity against PfTRAP contributes to the development of protection against severe malaria. Experimentally induced immunity against TRAP in different rodent models has consistently proven to elicit a high degree of protection against malaria. This together with the functional properties of TRAP and data describing CD4 and CD8 epitopes for PfTRAP indicate that this molecule could increase the protective efficiency of available sporozoite malaria vaccines.},

In further investigations (Schragle and Muller, 1989), C. perfringens strains were typed and isolated from the faeces of healthy animals, and 81.6\% belonging to the type C were found, a type that causes severe necrotic enteritis in pigs. Two figures show the pathologic-anatomic findings. Meanwhile, the disease was eradicated by the use of a prophylactic vaccination.},

Sera from infected cattle were included to compare stocks and clones from Kenya. The parasites that were used as antigen in the immune lysis tests were collected from infected mice when variable antigen type (VAT) homogeneous populations were used, from goats for infection with stocks and clones from Nigeria, The Gambia and Uganda, and from cattle for Kenyan stocks. Reciprocal cross-reactivity between sera and parasites was found between all the stocks and clones from Nigeria and The Gambia with the exception of one clone from Nigeria that was not recognized by antisera to a clone from The Gambia. There was also cross-reactivity between a stock and clone from Uganda and stocks and clones from Nigeria and The Gambia. Sera from goats infected with stocks and clones from Nigeria, The Gambia and Uganda recognized parasite populations that were homogeneous for one VAT (ILDat 1.2) of the rodent infective stock from Nigeria. Some antisera to West African stocks recognized another stable variant from a Ugandan stock adapted to rodents (ILDat 2.1), indicating that these VATs were expressed in the repertoires of the heterologous stocks. There was no cross-reaction between stocks from Nigeria, The Gambia or Uganda with Kenyan stocks. A stock from Galana (Kenya) and Bamburi (Kenya) showed reciprocal cross-reactivity. Two other Kenyan stocks, from Kilifi and Likoni, also showed cross-reactivity by immune lysis but showed no antigenic relationship with the other Kenyan stocks.},

As control of the rodent host is impracticable at present, the best immediate prospect is vaccination. We tested as potential vaccines in rhesus monkeys a closely related virus, Mopeia virus (two monkeys), and a recombinant vaccinia virus containing the Lassa virus glycoprotein gene, V-LSGPC (four monkeys). Two monkeys vaccinated with the New York Board of Health strain of vaccinia virus as controls died after challenge with Lassa virus. The two monkeys vaccinated with Mopeia virus developed antibodies measurable by radioimmunoprecipitation prior to challenge, and they survived challenge by Lassa virus with minimal physical or physiologic disturbances. However, both showed a transient, low-titer Lassa viremia. Two of the four animals vaccinated with V-LSGPC had antibodies to both Lassa glycoproteins, as determined by radioimmunoprecipitation. All four animals survived a challenge of Lassa virus but experienced a transient febrile illness and moderate physiologic changes following challenge. Virus was recoverable from each of these animals, but at low titer and only during a brief period, as observed for the Mopeia-protected animals. We conclude that V-LSGPC can protect rhesus monkeys against death from Lassa fever.},

Omnivorous, it is more or less a commensal of the man. The blood of 20 adults male and female specimens captured in the Sine Saloum (Fatik) and Presqu'Ille du Cap Vert (Dakar) regions was examined (peripheric blood smears). In 60 p. 100 (12/20) of hemograms, an intraerythrocytic organism of the genus Grahamella Brumpt 1911 was observed. Rod-shaped and carmine-coloured by staining technic of May-Grunwald and Giemsa, it is an unflagellate element. Slightly narrowed in the median part, it is 1 to 1.5 mu long and 0.25 mu wide. Multiplication by bipartition in the red cell plasma that may be occupied by 30 to 40 Grahamella. In chronic infection without morbid signs. 1/50 to 1/60 hematocyte is only infected. Electron micrograph of thin sections of red cells infected by Grahamella shows an element with a cell wall surrounding cytoplasmic masses which are enclosed in a cytoplasmic membrane. Nuclear region (bundles of moniliform chains = nucleic acids) is not surrounded by a nuclear membrane. Intraerythrocytic position. Bipolar densification of the cell plasma. The prokaryote is directly included in the erythrocyte plasma : no host cell vacuole is visible. Stress, polyinfection, polyparasitism or immuno-depressor effects, determine an intense proliferation of Grahamella by micrococcus elements (diameter : 0.1 to 0.3 mu) invading the systemic circulation. In that cases : septicaemia, anaemia; haematopoiesis with respiratory and nervous disorders; hyperthermia and weakness precede the death. This prokaryote is the first Baratonellacae found in the blood of the Giant Rat. It is namded Grahamella knaiae n. sp ("Kania" is the name of C. gambianus in "serere" language of Fatik region of Senegal). The fleas seem to be the vectors or this prokaryotic element.},

Two of the new taxa are sympatric and come from the poorly known left bank (direction source to mouth) of the Congo River. One of these (Hylomyscus pygmaeus sp. nov.) is easily recognized. as it is tiny and significantly smaller than any known species of the genus; the second new species (Hylomyscus thornesmithae sp. nov.) is also small, and syntopic with the first. The third new species (Hylomyscus stanleyi sp. nov.), from the SW corner of Tanzania, is quite large and had been previously included within the hypodigm of Hylomyscus anseM following its recognition from within the synonymy of Hylomyscus denniae. The fourth species (Hylonwscus mpungamachagorum sp. nov.) is from Mahale Mountains National Park, western Tanzania.

We performed an integrative study that allowed us to detect the existence of at least two species in the collected specimens. Two molecular clades, corresponding to different karyotypes, were recovered. By comparison with type specimens and using classical morphometric analyses, we are able to confirm the presence of L. linulus and L. striatus in Guinea. We redescribe the skull and dental characters of the poorly known L. linulus and report its standard karyotype formula (2N = 56, NFa = 66). We did not collect any L. zebra in Guinea despite its presence in South Mali. In conclusion, the distributions of L. striatus and L. linulus described for Guinea and, including the previously reported L. bellieri, three species are now known to occur in this country.

This study investigates the genetic diversity and possible origins of black rats from Benin, West Africa. We sequenced the complete mitochondrial cytochrome b gene in 90 individuals from nine localities in Benin. These sequences were subsequently compared to 390 other cytochrome b haplotypes from individuals from various European, Asian, American and African localities. Nucleotide polymorphism analysis, haplotype network and maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree reconstructions showed low mitochondrial diversity in black rats from Benin. Our results also suggest at least two distinct introduction events: one introduction probably occurred during the spice trade (15th-17th century) through the Indies Road connecting Europe to Asia. Other introduction events could have occurred more recently following the intensification of globalized trade from the eighteenth century, and onwards.},

They were mostly active during early morning (6:00-8:00) and late afternoon (16:00-18:00). The overall status of the current population does not appear in an immediate danger. However, there are many conservation problems that could affect the species in the future in the area. Therefore, appropriate conservation measures should be taken in to consideration to protect golden jackal and create suitable habitat.},

Prey animals comprised three vertebrate taxa (mammal, reptile and bird), of which mammals dominated, ranging over Primates, rodents, carnivores, hyraxes and bovids. Diversity of prey taxa increased in the later stage of the nestling period.

Tameness and reproductive ability are two important traits that underlie any successful animal domestication event. Androgen receptor gene has been reported to influence behaviour and fertility. The objective of this study was to identify genetic polymorphism in the androgen receptor gene that is likely to influence tameness and reproductive traits. Tissue samples were collected from a total of 116 including 81 domestic and 35 wild grasscutters in Accra and Mankessim, respectively, and genotyped at the androgen receptor glutamine repeat (ARQ) locus. Results of this study showed that ARQ ranges from six to 19 repeats and heterozygosities (H) were 0.769 and 0.778 for domestic and wild females respectively, indicating that this locus is highly polymorphic in grasscutters. As this locus influences transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor gene, these polymorphisms could influence tameness and reproductive traits in grasscutter. However, further studies are required to test the association of these polymorphisms with phenotypes.},

	issn = {0340-5443},
	abstract = {The ability to differentiate among conspecifics on the basis of genetic relatedness can be advantageous in kin and mate selection. Selection of mates that are of an intermediate degree of relatedness maximizes the propagation of shared genes to offspring, while minimizing the accumulation of deleterious recessive alleles that can result from close inbreeding. Odors produced from various glandular surfaces of the body have been shown to influence discrimination of conspecifics in numerous taxa, including the order Rodentia. We investigated whether female Cape ground squirrels (Xerus inauris) discriminate between the odors of familiar and foreign males by conducting scent experiments. We simultaneously presented odors that had been collected on acrylic cubes from the anal gland of a familiar (non-dispersed) and a foreign male as well as an unscented control, and recorded the response of focal pregnant and non-pregnant females (n = 19). Non-pregnant females responded differently to the odors of the scent cubes, sniffing the scent collected from the foreign male significantly longer than either the familiar male or control odor, whereas there was no difference in the response of pregnant females. We conclude that male familiarity may influence female mate choice, as familiarity is reliably correlated with relatedness in this population. Based on prior knowledge about the social behavior of Cape ground squirrels, the ability to discriminate between familiar and foreign males may be used by females as an inbreeding avoidance mechanism, as close inbreeding can be avoided by mating with foreign males.},

	abstract = {1. Ebola virus is responsible for the fatal Ebola virus disease (EVD). 2. Identifying the distribution area of the Ebola virus is crucial for understanding the risk factors conditioning the emergence of new EVD cases. Existing distribution models have underrepresented the potential contribution that reservoir species and vulnerable species make in sustaining the presence of the virus. 3. In this paper, we map favourable areas for Ebola virus in Africa according to environmental and zoogeographical descriptors, independent of human-to-human transmissions. We combine two different biogeographical approaches: analysis of mammalian distribution types (chorotypes), and distribution modelling of the Ebola virus. 4. We first obtain a model defining the distribution of environmentally favourable areas for the presence of Ebola virus. Based on a review of mammal taxa affected by or suspected of exposure to the Ebola virus, we model favourable areas again, this time according to mammalian chorotypes. We then build a combined model in which both the environment and mammalian distributions explain the favourable areas for Ebola virus in the wild. 5. We demonstrate that mammalian biogeography contributes to explaining the distribution of Ebola virus in Africa, although vegetation may also underscore clear limits to the presence of the virus. Our model suggests that the Ebola virus may be even more widespread than previously suspected, given that additional favourable areas are found throughout the coastal areas of West and Central Africa, stretching from Cameroon to Guinea, and extend further East into the East African Lakes region. 6. Our findings show that the most favourable area for the Ebola virus is significantly associated with the presence of the virus in non-human mammals. Core areas are surrounded by regions of intermediate favourability, in which human infections of unknown source were found. The difference in association between humans and other mammals and the virus may offer further insights on how EVD can spread.},

	abstract = {An individual's survival and fitness depend on its ability to effectively allocate its time between competing behaviors. Sex, social tactic, season and food availability are important factors influencing activity budgets. However, few field studies have tested their influences. The African striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio) lives in highly seasonal habitats in southern Africa, and individuals can adopt different social tactics. We investigated seasonal changes in activity budgets of different tactics and predicted that individuals will reduce their activity in the non-breeding season to save energy when food availability is low and that young non-breeding adults ('philopatrics') invest mainly in activities related to gaining body mass to increase survival probability. We predicted old adults ('breeders'), which bred during the previous breeding season, to invest mainly in maintenance of their social status. We conducted 90 focal observations during the non-breeding season and 73 during the breeding season. Activity budgets of striped mice were season and tactic specific, with philopatrics, but not breeders, reducing activity when food availability was low, possibly to decrease energy expenditure. Philopatrics of both sexes foraged and basked more in the breeding season than during the non-breeding season. Male philopatrics gained body mass and female philopatrics maintained their body mass in both seasons. Sex-specific differences occurred during the breeding season, when female breeders foraged more than male breeders, while male breeders chased other individuals more than female breeders. These findings indicate that individuals adopting different social tactics display distinct behaviors to fulfill tactic-specific energetic needs.},

	abstract = {The archaeological and paleontological records from the west coast of South Africa have potential to provide insights into ecosystem dynamics in the region during the mid-Pleistocene. Although the fossil record suggests an ecosystem quite different than that of the region today, we understand little about the ecological factors that contributed to this disparity. The site of Elandsfontein (EFT) dates to between 1.0 and 0.6 million years ago (Ma), preserves in situ lithic and faunal materials found in direct association with each other, and provides the rare opportunity to examine the relationship between hominin behavioral variability and landscape heterogeneity in a winter rainfall ecosystem. In this study, we examine the stable carbon isotopic composition of a large sample (n = 81) of Cape dune mole-rats (Bathyergus suillus) and contemporaneous large mammals ({\textgreater}6 kg; n = 194) from EFT. We find that [delta]13C values of B. suillus are significantly different to those of contemporaneous large mammals from EFT indicating a significant presence of plants utilizing the C4 photosynthetic pathway during the mid-Pleistocene, in contrast to present C3 dominated ecosystems along the west coast of South Africa. Additionally, we find that artifact density at EFT localities is positively correlated with [delta]13C values in B. suillus enamel suggesting that evidence of more intense hominin occupation may be associated with the presence of more C4 vegetation. Lastly, we hypothesize that this unique distribution of vegetation 1) provided abundant resources for both hominin and non-hominin taxa and 2) may have concentrated hominin and animal behavior in certain places on the ancient landscape.

And where they prove harmful, more information can assist to evaluate and control the effects rats have on man. This article reviews the studies that have been carried out on wild rats in Nigeria and other parts of Africa. The studies reviewed in this article, on the one hand, showcase the vital contribution rats make to maintaining biodiversity across various ecological zones within the country. On the other hand, the article recognizes the role of certain species of multimammate rat and the African wood mouse as reservoirs of the deadly Lassa virus. Based on these parallel lines of evidence, it is concluded that while it is crucial to control commensal rats that dwell in close proximity to humans, it is equally important to conserve wild rats in the natural environment.},

In present study, the phylogenetic and taxonomic relationships in the genus Jaculus from Iran were examined using molecular, geometric morphometric and morphologic data. Our molecular analyses indicated two monophyletic clades which contain J. jaculus and J. blanfordi. There is a high amount of genetic interspecific distance (12.7\%) between J. jaculus and J. blanfordi, while the intraspecific divergence within these two species is low. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) of morphometric variables were significant (P{\textless}0.05) and shows that J. jaculus is significantly smaller than J. blanfordi. Statistical Analysis on outline data shows that there is an intraspecific geographic variation in 2nd lower molar shape in J. blanfordi so that northern populations are determinable from the south ones (Pvalue= 0.016). Although the findings strengthen an idea of presence of two subspecies in northeast and southeast of Iran, it would require further studies. In this study, expansion of J. jaculus to the center of Iran, suggests that it is sympatric with J. blanfordi in Esfahan province.},

Infected birds play role in transmitting the virus over long distances. Human and horses are high level susceptible to infection, and fever, neurological infection and meningoencephalitis can occur with the progress of the infection. The disease is endemic in Africa and some of Asia countries, but in recent years it is also encountered in Europe and in the Western hemisphere. Eliminating of mosquitoes is important in the prevention of disease. For vaccination, vaccine containing genetically modified virus strains or inactivated viruses can be used for horses and birds.

	volume = {428},
	issn = {0012-821X},
	abstract = {The stable isotope composition of small mammal tissues has the potential to provide detailed information about terrestrial palaeoclimate and environments, because their remains are abundant in palaeontological and archaeological sites, and they have restricted home ranges. Applications to the Quaternary record, however, have been sparse and limited by an acute lack of understanding of small mammal isotope ecology, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. Here we document the oxygen and carbon isotope composition of Gerbillinae (gerbil) tooth apatite across a rainfall gradient in northwestern Africa, in order to test the relative influences of the 18O/16O in precipitation or moisture availability on gerbil teeth values, the sensitivity of tooth apatite 13C/12C to plant responses to moisture availability, and the influence of developmental period on the isotopic composition of gerbil molars and incisors. The results show that the isotopic composition of molars and incisors from the same individuals differs consistent with the different temporal periods reflected by the teeth; molar teeth are permanently rooted and form around the time of birth, whereas incisors grow continuously. The results indicate that tooth choice is an important consideration for applications as proxy Quaternary records, but also highlights a new potential means to distinguish seasonal contexts. The oxygen isotope composition of gerbil tooth apatite is strongly correlated with mean annual precipitation (MAP) below 600 mm, but above 600 mm the teeth reflect the oxygen isotope composition of local meteoric water instead. Predictably, the carbon isotope composition of the gerbil teeth reflected C3 and C4 dietary inputs, however arid and mesic sites could not be distinguished because of the high variability displayed in the carbon isotope composition of the teeth due to the microhabitat and short temporal period reflected by the gerbil. We show that the oxygen isotope composition of small mammal teeth strongly reflects moisture availability in semi-arid and arid environments and would provide an excellent record of palaeo-aridity in a terrestrial setting. The results illustrate that an understanding of an animal's physiology is essential for interpreting the animal's isotopic responses to external contexts, especially in arid zones.

	abstract = {Understanding historical influences of climate and physiographic barriers in shaping patterns of biodiversity remains limited for many regions of the world. For mammals of continental Africa, phylogeographic studies, particularly for West African lineages, implicate both geographic barriers and climate oscillations in shaping small mammal diversity. In contrast, studies for southern African species have revealed conflicting phylogenetic patterns for how mammalian lineages respond to both climate change and geologic events such as river formation, especially during the Pleistocene. However, these studies were often biased by limited geographic sampling or exclusively focused on large-bodied taxa. We exploited the broad southern African distribution of a savanna-woodland-adapted African rodent, Gerbilliscus leucogaster (bushveld gerbil) and generated mitochondrial, autosomal and sex chromosome data to quantify regional signatures of climatic and vicariant biogeographic phenomena. Results indicate the most recent common ancestor for all G.leucogaster lineages occurred during the early Pleistocene. We documented six divergent mitochondrial lineages that diverged [approximately]0.270-0.100mya, each of which was geographically isolated during periods characterized by alterations to the course of the Zambezi River and its tributaries as well as regional megadroughts'. Results demonstrate the presence of a widespread lineage exhibiting demographic expansion [approximately]0.065-0.035mya, a time that coincides with savanna-woodland expansion across southern Africa. A multilocus autosomal perspective revealed the influence of the Kafue River as a current barrier to gene flow and regions of secondary contact among divergent mitochondrial lineages. Our results demonstrate the importance of both climatic fluctuations and physiographic vicariance in shaping the distribution of southern African biodiversity.},

We analyzed complete SNP matrices of {\textgreater}50,000 RAD loci to delineate populations, reconstruct the history of isolation and admixture, and discover geographic patterns of genetic partitioning. These analyses demonstrate that persistently unsuitable habitat may have isolated multiple populations distributed across montane habitat islands in the Itombwe Massif and Albertine Rift to the west as well as Mt Elgon and Kenyan Highlands to the east. We detected low genetic diversity in Kenyan Highland populations of both genera, consistent with smaller historical population sizes in this region. We additionally tested predictions that Albertine Rift populations are older and more persistently isolated compared to the Kenyan Highlands. Phylogenetic analyses support greater historical isolation among Albertine Rift populations of both shrews and mice compared to the Kenyan Highlands and suggest that there are genetically isolated populations from both focal genera in the Itombwe Massif, Democratic Republic of Congo. The Albertine Rift ecoregion has the highest mammalian tropical forest species richness per unit area on earth. Our results clearly support accelerating efforts to conserve this diversity.},

The South American nutria or coypu is now considered a pest in the area of introduction, because of its negative impact on biological diversity and ecological relationships. Having information on the invasion range of exotic species is crucial for understanding the ecology of invasive spread and for making good conservation and management planning to address this problem. At the beginning of the 20th century, nutria was introduced into Asia. Nutria was recorded for the first time in Iran in 1995. In the present study we proposed a multiple spatial scale approach to predict the invasion trends of the nutria in Iran, and to define up the "suitable scale" for predicting the invasion trends of this species. Our results highlighted the importance of environmental variables including vegetation density (for food and nesting) and water resource (streams, rivers, and lakes) in distribution of the nutria. Potential areas for the presence of the nutria are located near the Caspian Sea, west and central Iran which receive more precipitation than other parts of the country. Therefore, these parts of Iran may face a much greater risk of invasion risk in the future. Moreover, these results can show the possible risk of nutria invasion to the northern and western neighbors of Iran. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In Southeastern Nigeria, its known range is strictly limited to the localities close to the Cameroon border and just east of the Cross River. This article reports some original data on the diet of B. nigripes, the first objectively positive data on this species according to the analysis of their stomach contents. Moreover, these are the first data collected in Nigeria, including the first known record west of the Cross River. B. nigripes seems to be slowly expanding its range westward. Most of its prey were vertebrates, mainly mammals, followed by reptiles and birds. Invertebrate prey was also found, mainly insects, followed by centipedes. In terms of their frequency of occurrence, insects and other arthropods (50.48\%) were consumed significantly more often than any other type of prey. Both arthropods (88.88\%) and mammals (88.88\%) were almost always present in the examined stomachs. Larger prey (mammals), such as Cricetomys emini (1.9\% of the total number of prey) and Xerus erythropus (0.95\%) were occasionally preyed upon, as well as small snakes (1.9\%). Comparing these results with the limited information available thus far, it is evident that there are more prey taxa, in addition to food categories, than previously estimated, and overall this demonstrates that arthropods and mammals are the most commonly consumed prey, the first because they are certainly more numerous, while the latter are far more significant in terms of biomass. In fact, the analysis indicates that mammals (79.21\%), and especially large rodents (59.23\%), were the main contributors in terms of biomass. Conversely, small prey, in particular arthropods, some of which are tiny, are of decidedly low trophic significance (5.43\%).},

	abstract = {West African Mountains of the Cameroon Volcanic Line harbour two montane-endemic species of laminated-toothed rats (Otomys), which represent the most westerly occurrence of the genus. We explore here through mtDNA sequencing and cranial morphometrics the taxonomic status and phylogenetic relationships of O. burtoni (Mt Cameroon) and O. occidentalis (Mts Oku and Gotel). We conclude that both species are valid and can be discriminated by molecular data, as well as quantitative and qualitative cranial characters. From molecular data, O. occidentalis and O. burtoni are closest neighbours (p-distance = 7.5-8.5\%) and weakly associated sister species (suggesting a single West African radiation) and both are sister clades to a well supported clade of central, East and northeast African members of the O. typus s.l. and O. tropicalis s.l. species complexes from mountain ranges comprising the East African 'Montane Circle' and Ethiopian Highlands. Re-evaluation of the evolutionary origins of the allopatric Otomys populations in equatorial Africa is undertaken in light of fossil evidence of a southern African origin of the genus. We can conclude that Otomys reached the Cameroon Volcanic Line via corridors of temperate grasslands during the Late Pliocene. Our data support the hypothesis that, following major peripatric speciation events at around 2.3 to 2.03 Ma (from East Africa into West and North Africa respectively), further speciation occurred across neighbouring mountain ranges in West, Central-East and North-East Africa. Estimated molecular dates of speciation events in Otomys reveal close congruence with well-constrained geochronological estimates, pertinently the uplift of the Albertine Rift in the Early Pleistocene. These regional analyses reveal how peripatric speciation events established narrow-range endemics of Otomys on principal stratovolcanoes across the East African plateau and Cameroon.

	abstract = {The Eastern Afromontane region of Africa is characterized by striking levels of endemism and species richness accompanied by significant conservation threat, a pattern typical across biodiversity hotspots. Using multi-locus molecular data under a coalescent species tree framework we identify major cryptic biogeographic patterns within and between two endemic montane small mammal species complexes, Hylomyscus mice and Sylvisorex shrews, co-distributed across the Albertine Rift and Kenya Highlands of the Eastern Afromontane Biodiversity Hotspot (EABH). Hypotheses put forward to account for the high diversity of the region include retention of older palaeo-endemic lineages across major regions in climatically stable refugia, as well as the accumulation of lineages associated with more recent differentiation between allopatric populations separated by unsuitable habitat during periods of Pleistocene aridification. Sympatric pairs of sister lineages were found to have significantly older divergence times than allopatric pairs. Genetic analyses and historical distribution modeling suggest that regional meta-populations have persisted since the Pliocene to mid-Pleistocene across a climatic gradient from the Albertine Rift in the west to the Kenya Highlands in the east for both focal taxa. Differing patterns of regional sub-division and demographic expansion were detected and are consistent with differing life histories as well as shared responses to regional variation in stability of suitable habitat. There is also strong support in both mice and shrew species for Late Miocene divergence with subsequent range expansion into sympatry in previously unidentified cryptic species pairs. These results highlight the broad temporal scale at which climatic and geological changes may have facilitated rare dispersal events between montane habitats as well as the long-term persistence of populations in both the Albertine Rift and the Kenyan Highlands that together contributed to the high species diversity and endemism in the EABH.

We examined whether harassment was part of alloparental care by comparing harassment behaviours among different age and sex classes in Cape ground squirrel social groups. We also assessed how individuals adjusted their behaviour dependent on levels of risk by examining the Cape ground squirrel's harassment behaviour among non-venomous, and two species of venomous snakes. We found adult females with emerged juvenile offspring took the most risk, harassing for longer durations and at higher intensities than other group members, suggesting that snake harassment was a maternal behaviour. Females with juvenile offspring only harassed the highest risk elapid snake but increased vigilance and inspection with increasing snake risk suggesting that the Cape ground squirrel can discriminate between different types of snake predators.},

Genome sequences have identified evidence for a striking expansion of and positive selection in gene families associated with immunity. Bats have also been known to be hosts of malaria parasites for over a century, and as hosts, they possess perhaps the most phylogenetically diverse set of hemosporidian genera and species. To provide a molecular framework for the study of these parasites, we surveyed bats in three remote areas of the Upper Guinean forest ecosystem. We detected four distinct genera of hemosporidian parasites: Plasmodium, Polychromophilus, Nycteria, and Hepatocystis. Intriguingly, the two species of Plasmodium in bats fall within the clade of rodent malaria parasites, indicative of multiple host switches across mammalian orders. We show that Nycteria species form a very distinct phylogenetic group and that Hepatocystis parasites display an unusually high diversity and prevalence in epauletted fruit bats. The diversity and high prevalence of novel lineages of chiropteran hemosporidians underscore the exceptional position of bats among all other mammalian hosts of hemosporidian parasites and support hypotheses of pathogen tolerance consistent with the exceptional immunology of bats.},

Arvicanthis niloticus and Praomys daltoni were also abundant, followed by Mastomys natalensis and Gerbilliscus guineae. Abundances were high at the beginning of the rainy season when reproductive activity was low in all species. At the end of the rainy season, murine rodents were actively involved in reproduction, while gerbilline rodents were at their lowest density. Significant changes in relative abundance among habitats (including human dwellings) were observed between periods in some species, suggesting seasonal trends in habitat preferences.

	abstract = {Associations among organisms are thought to form because the benefits, such as increased foraging efficiency or decreased risk of predation, outweigh any costs, such as resource competition. Though many interspecific associations have been described for closely related mammals, few studies have examined the associations between mammals in different orders. The yellow mongoose (Cynictus pencillata), a carnivore, and the Cape ground squirrel (Xerus inauris), a rodent, co-occur in arid and semi-arid South Africa where they share sleeping burrows, predators, a similar body size, and the capability to emit alarm calls in response to predators. To investigate enhanced predator avoidance as a potential benefit explaining the persistence of this association, we assessed individual mongoose vigilance alone and with squirrels or other mongooses, and with varying interspecific group size, using field observations. We also tested for responses to conspecific and heterospecific alarm calls in both study species using playback experiments. The proportion of time mongoose individuals spent vigilant decreased in the presence of squirrels or other mongooses and was negatively correlated with interspecific group size; a similar pattern was previously shown for conspecific groups of Cape ground squirrels. These results are predicted by both the dilution and collective detection hypotheses. In addition, hetero- and conspecific alarm calls elicited vigilance responses in both species. These results suggest that both species can benefit from the collective detection and dilution arising from their interspecific association and that this interspecific association could be mutualistic.},

	abstract = {The black rat R. rattus and the Norway rat R. norvegicus are nocturnal rodents (Muridae), that originated in Asia but are now considered to be cosmopolitan because they can adapt to practically all types of environments. These species have been the object of many karyological studies that helped to establish a chromosomal polymorphism based on geographical distribution. For R. rattus, many geographical types have been described. An Asian type with a diploid number 2n = 42, that covers all of South and Southwest Asia, is considered to be the ancestral type. There is also a Japanese type with 2n = 42, a Sri-Lankan type with 2n = 40 located in West Asia, and an oceanic type with 2n = 38 that has spread through the rest of the world. For karyological study we followed the air-drying method. The chromosomes were observed with a NIKON H-III microscope under the 100x objective, after Giemsa staining was applied. Our karyological investigations of the genus Rattus carried out on 39 individuals of Rattus rattus and 15 of R. norvegicus. The karyotype of R. rattus shows a diploid number of 2n = 38 and a fundamental number of autosomes (NFa) varying from 58 to 60. It is interesting to note that only the oceanic type presents two large metacentric pairs of chromosomes, resulting from two successive Robertsonian fusions between the pairs 4-7 and the pairs 11-12. However, this chromosomal structure shows intra- and inter-populational variation. This karyotype reminds us of that defined in the Mediterranean, which corresponds to the oceanic type. It shows a supernumerary B chromosome with a frequency of 0.07 and the pair 13 has a variable morphology, probably due to a pericentric inversion, and gives the subtelocentric (ST) form with a frequency of 0.10. Otherwise, comparison of our results with those reported in the literature, particularly those for the Mediterranean, fit within the limits established for the oceanic type of R. rattus. On the contrary, in R. norvegicus the diploid number remains constant with 2n = 42 and a fundamental number of autosomes (NFa) of 62. These karyotypes are the same as those defined in North Africa and Europe. Finally, we suggest that our specimens of R. rattus and R. norvegicus show a close affinity with those identified in Europe.},

	abstract = {The African pygmy mouse, Mus minutoides, is one of the very few mammal species that deviates from the classical mammalian XX/XY sex chromosome system by presenting a high proportion of fully fertile sex-reversed females. Since the still unknown sex reversal mutation is X-linked (X*), they are designated as X*Y females. Until now, X*Y females had only been identified in Southern Africa, but data were lacking for the rest of the vast sub-Saharan distribution range of this species. In this study, the PCR genotyping of the Y-linked Sry gene on 72 females from Western Africa (Guinea, Ivory Coast and Ghana) uncovered 10 sex-reversed females distributed in the 3 countries. This expands our understanding of the geographical distribution and temporal origin (dated at 0.9 mya) of the sex reversal mutation. In addition, we sequenced and analyzed a fragment of the Sry gene (including the complete high-mobility group, i.e. HMG box, and the partial C-terminal region). The results demonstrate the presence of multiple polymorphic copies of the gene as reported in other rodent species and reveal, more unexpectedly, an extremely high proportion of amino acid replacement within the HMG box. In effect, the predicted HMG box protein sequence similarity between some populations of M. minutoides is as low as 94.9\%, and at the interspecific level (within genus), it drops to only 91.1\% between M. minutoides and M. musculus.

We carried out extensive specimen sampling in Senegal, West Africa, and used microsatellite markers to describe the pattern and processes of invasion in this large continental area. The genetic data obtained were combined with historical knowledge concerning the presence of this species in Senegal. Data were analysed by a combination of Bayesian clustering and approximate Bayesian computation methods. The invasion pathways closely paralleled the history of human trade routes in Senegal. In several places, we detected the occurrence of multiple introductions from genetically different sources. Long-distance migration between towns and villages was also observed. Our findings suggest that genetic bottlenecks and admixture have played a major role in shaping the genetics of invasive black rats.

The new species is also smaller in size than D. oreas from Mount Cameroon. The new species has morphological similarities with karyo-typed specimens of D. messorius from Ippy (Central African Republic) and the so-called D. melanotis from La Maboke, Gabon, but has a distinct karyotype. It is close in morphology to D. messorius from the Cameroon lowlands. This is the first time G and C banding were employed for members of the genus Dendromus, and the karyotype of the new species confirms that it may be a sibling species of the D. messorius "complex", for which the distribution and measure of species diversity in west central Africa are far from resolved. The new species occurs in Guinean and Liberian montane savannas of Mount Nimba and in banana and quinine plantations around Mount Ziama, Guinea. It is also known from the Ivory Coast. The presence of this new species highlights the importance of altitude savannas and forests of the Nimba region for conservation.},

The taxonomic rank of the principal genus group is assessed and the mode of diversification of species of the P. tullbergi complex in Afrotropical forests is discussed based on estimates of times to the most recent common ancestors and on tree topologies. This study documents for the first time the molecular and morphometrical distinctiveness of P. hartwigi and P. morio within the P. tullbergi species complex. Further studies including specimens of P. hartwigi from all its distribution range are needed to conclude on the status of P. obscurus. The monophyly of the genus Praomys is refuted. Times to the most recent common ancestors of major clades within the P. tullbergi species complex are estimated for the last 2.5 Mya and during the last 1 or 2 Mya for different species or forms. The lowland forest refuge hypothesis might well explain the diversification of P. misonnei, P. rostratus and P. tullbergi in the guineo-congolese forest block. The isolation of montane forests could have facilitated the divergence between the two montane forest forms P. hartwigi and P. obscurus and between populations of P. morio from the continent and those from the island of Bioko. Praomys populations (species) that inhabit the Cameroon Volcanic Line Praomys probably originated as lowland forms subsequently specialized to highland conditions.},

The second clade can be further divided into three sub-clades. The results of neutrality tests and mismatch distributions indicate that a population expansion occurred in these sub-clades. During the middle or upper Pleistocene, the west-Central African populations of R misonnei may have been isolated in four different forest refugia, followed by population expansion and secondary contact during more humid periods. High genetic diversity was observed in the region of the Bakossi highlands, and the Cameroon Volcanic Line limits the geographical distribution of clades. Thus it seems likely that this volcanic line has in the past constituted a barrier that prevented the east west exchange between R misonnei populations through the expansion of the montane forest habitat. Our results also highlight the role of the Sanaga and Ogooue-Ivindo rivers in shaping R misonnei genetic structure.},

Demographic analyses revealed different modalities of population expansion since the last glacial age depending on geographic areas.

The reconstructed demography showed that the evolutionary histories of the species are markedly different and that the expansion into North-West Africa by J. deserti was more recent than that of J. jaculus. The weak ecological separation between species and the signs of recent population growth and expansion of J. deserti suggest that its sympatric occurrence with J. jaculus is recent and that these species evolved in isolated populations, after diverging around the Pliocene[long dash]Pleistocene boundary.

Existing hypotheses of how Y. pestis is maintained within plague foci typically center on host abundance or diversity, but little attention has been paid to the importance of flea diversity in enzootic maintenance. Our study compares host and flea abundance and diversity along an elevation gradient that spans from low elevation sites outside of a plague focus in the West Nile region of Uganda ({\textasciitilde}725-1160 m) to higher elevation sites within the focus ({\textasciitilde}1380-1630 m). Based on a year of sampling, we showed that host abundance and diversity, as well as total flea abundance on hosts was similar between sites inside compared with outside the plague focus. By contrast, flea diversity was significantly higher inside the focus than outside. Our study highlights the importance of considering flea diversity in models of Y. pestis persistence.},

	abstract = {Gerbils of the genus Gerbillus represent an important part of small mammal diversity in arid regions of North Africa, but their taxonomy and evolutionary systematics and biogeography are still poorly known. Based on the recent collection of a series of gerbils in southern Morocco, including at the type localities of three endemic species, we gathered morphological, chromosomal and molecular data on a number of specimens that we compared with other available results. These data provide new insights into the geographical distribution of the endemic species known to date and suggest that an additional and previously undetected species may exist within this area. Multivariate analyses of morphometrical skull data validated the criteria used in the description of some of these species, while confirming the morphological similarity of a set of medium to large-sized species with hairy feet that can be considered sibling species. Karyotypes were useful for the specific assignation of a number of specimens. Molecular phylogenetics and divergence time estimates allow us to draw the first picture of the evolutionary relationships between endemic Gerbillus species from Morocco and related species of North Africa, and to estimate their respective timing of diversification. Most of the lineage emergence events took place during the Pleistocene, a period characterised by a global aridification of North Africa, but more importantly by important climatic and eustatic variations that may have played a role in species differentiation and subsequent expansion. This integrative approach proved to be essential in such species group including morphologically similar species. It also enables to propose testable hypotheses as to possible scenarios of emergence and evolution of these species along the western margin of the Sahara desert.},

Using pitfall buckets, small mammal traps, and mist-nets, between 1991 and 1993, we surveyed the small mammals in the Amani area in the East Usambara and Ambangulu area in the West Usambara to document the natural history of the local fauna. These surveys were conducted during the dry season annually between early July and early September. In this chapter, we outline the study sites, methodologies, capture rates, and other trapping details. A total of 18,563 sample-nights was accrued over the three-year study, and on these two massifs, we documented 12 crocidurine shrew, one macroscelidid elephant shrew, 19 bat, and 14 rodent species. Species accumulation curves suggest that additional trapping effort may be required in the East Usambara Mountains to have a more complete view of the local small mammal fauna. There was no significant difference in the number of individuals captured or measures of species diversity in the pitfall and trap lines that were installed in the same location during the course of this study, suggesting that repeated sampling did not negatively affect the small mammal fauna of the study areas.},

The general trapping protocol used involved both pitfall lines and trap lines (Sherman, Victor, and Museum Special traps), with a limited number of animals trapped within and outside of forest habitats by local people. A total of 885 individual rodents, representing 15 species, were collected during this study. For the East and West Usambara Mountains, 13 (12 native) and 12 (all native) rodent species were recorded, respectively. Most rodents were captured by trap lines (96.6\%); a few individuals were captured in the pitfall devices or brought to us by local people. The major exception is that all individuals of Dendromus (n = 11) obtained during the survey were in pitfall buckets. A total of 18,563 sample-nights were accrued over the three years, including 11,339 sample-nights (3314 pitfall-nights and 8025 trap-nights) in the East Usambara and 7224 sample-nights (1924 pitfall-nights and 5300 trap-nights) in the West Usambara Mountains. Based on species accumulation curves, no previously unrecorded species was trapped after 11,064 sample-nights in the East Usambara and after 5213 sample-nights in the West Usambara. However, a previously untrapped rodent (Graphiurus kelleni) was captured in the East Usambara on the third-to-last of 59 sampling days, suggesting that other non-canopy[long dash]restricted rodent species may have been missed during this survey. In a series of species accounts, information regarding the natural history of the different taxa handled during these surveys, including distribution, ecology, and condition of sexual organs, a list of referable specimens, and the trap devices that collected them, are presented. Trap and bucket lines combine to effectively sample most small- to medium-sized rodents. However, larger scansorial and canopy-restricted (squirrel) and fossorial (mole rat) species were not captured with our trapping methods, and these tabulations should not be considered a complete list of the small mammals of the Usambaras.},

	abstract = {We studied the co-occurrence of flea species in infracommunities of 16 rodents from four regions (South Africa, Tanzania, central Europe and western Siberia) using null models, and predicted that flea co-occurrences will be expressed more strongly in male than in female hosts. We examined patterns of co-occurrence (measured as the C score) in infracommunities of fleas that are parasitic on male and female hosts by comparing co-occurrence frequencies with those expected by chance. When a significant degree of nonrandomness in flea co-occurrences was detected, it indicated aggregative infracommunity structure. In Tanzanian rodents, no significant flea co-occurrences were detected in either male or female hosts. In a South African rodent, significant flea co-occurrences were not detected in males, but were found in females in some localities. In Palaearctic rodents, significant nonrandomness was detected either equally for males and females or more frequently in males than in females. Meta-analyses demonstrated that the frequency of the detection of nonrandomness in flea co-occurrences was significantly higher in male than in female hosts. The values of the standardized effect size (SES) for the C score differed significantly among host species, but not between host genders. When the Palaearctic hosts were analyzed separately, the effects of both host gender and species appeared to be significant, with the SES values for the C score in males being smaller than those in females. The strength of the gender difference in the manifestation of flea community structure increased with increasing gender difference in flea species richness, and with decreasing gender difference in flea prevalence for the Palaearctic hosts. We conclude that male hosts are the main drivers of flea infracommunity structure. However, the manifestation of gender bias in flea community structure varies among host species, and is likely determined by the pattern of species-specific spatial behavior.},

These sequences were compared to those of M. minutoides from other African countries and to eight other species of the genus Mus. We performed maximum likelihood, Bayesian and nested clade analyses, as well as neutrality tests and time estimates. We show that M. minutoides is a well-differentiated monophyletic species that separated from other pygmy mice 1.17 Myr ago. A distinct West Central African M. minutoides clade diverged early from the other African populations of the species, with a more recent common ancestor dating 0.14 Myr. West Central African populations are globally homogeneous, despite the present fragmentation of savannahs by the rain forest. However, our analyses show an unexpected vicariance between geographically close savannahs, embedded in the rain forest in Central Gabon. One of these populations is genetically more similar to very distant peripheral populations than to three closely neighbouring populations situated on both sides of the Ogooue River. A non-river geographical barrier probably persisted in this area, durably isolating these local populations. This hypothesis about the history of the savannah landscape should be testable through the biogeographical analysis of other strict savannah small mammal species.},

The geographical gradient was not gradual, but was characterized by a step cline on both sides of the 45th parallel, that is between the Mediterranean zone and the western European Continent. Within each of these compartments, no latitudinal variation from North to South was observed. The decrease in size of the house mouse since the Gallo-Roman period, or likely since the end of the Middle-Ages, could be due to landscape clearance and expansion of cereal-like cultivations.

	abstract = {Rodent diagnosis has long remained obscured by the co-existence of cryptic species in many lineages. However, alternative and accessible methods, such as cytotaxonomy and DNA-based methods, are now available that allow biologists to accurately monitor biodiversity through the production of well documented lists of unambiguously species-specific identifications. As a continuation of our previous surveys of West African rodents, we here present the first rodent inventory of rodents from Northern Cameroon (as well as one locality in Western Chad) that fully relies on karyotypic and/or sequencing data. Doing so, we assess the presence of 18 species in this poorly documented region. Among them, we found several African spiny mice that could be referred as to A. johannis, a poorly documented species. Moreover, several Arvicanthis individuals could be aggregated with previously studied but still enigmatic specimens of ANI-2 and ANI-4 sensu Volobouev etal. (2002a,b), thus suggesting that they may all belong to one single species, namely A. rufinus. In addition, one specimen was shown to belong to a new biological species (Praomys sp.) that will deserve further taxonomic investigations. Finally, several Taterillus specimens were found with 2n =28-30 chromosomes and a XX/XY1Y2 sex chromosome system. On the basis of these new results as well as a reinterpretation of previously published data, we propose to refer these individuals as to the poorly documented Taterillus lacustris. Altogether, our data suggest that Northern Cameroon is a "phylogeographical node" for several rodent lineages which may be at least partly explained by the past changes within the Lake Chad basin. Keeping this in mind, there is little doubt that biodiversity will undergo important modifications in the coming decades, following the increasing aridity and the drastic reduction of Lake Chad.

	abstract = {Genus Meriones is the dominant member of gerbils in the Palaearctic region, particularly in aride region of Asia. This is also one of the most typical genus of subfamily Gerbillinae with about 17 morphospecies namely: M. persicus, M. hurrianae, M. zarudnyi M. vinogradovi, M. meridianus, M. libycus, M. crassus, M. tristrami, M. rex, M. tamariscinus, M. unguiculatus, M. shawi, M. grandis, M. sacramenti, M.dahli, M.chengi, M.arimalius . Of which first eight species have been recorded from the Iranian Plateau. There are minor differences between some species and hence, interspecific discrimination of specimens from each species is not always possible, even by polythetic methods using different taxonomic characters such as tympanic bullae, suprameatal triangle and external characters on material from museums and dental characters on archeozoological materials. Here, 26 morphological characters of 384 museum specimens belonging to 14 morphospecies of Meriones from North Africa, Iran and Central Asia were studied. This study review, 14 species of Meriones and based on the results, it seems that M.libycus, M. crassus and M. meridianus are complex species and need taxonomic revision. The cladistics analysis shows that M. vinogradovi could be forming ancestral species of genus Meriones, and west of Caspian Sea could be the center of origin for Meriones. Due to the presence of convergence regarding adaptation of different species of Meriones to similar environment, subgeneric morphological characters may cause homoplasies and paraphyletic subgenera the analysis of morphological character states matrix, using Mix program of Phylip shows different four clades that did not conform to the nominative subgenera and unveil probable homoplasy.},

In the black-tailed tree rat (Thallomys nigricauda) we expected differences in the home-range size of populations in habitats of differing productivity, as measured along an aridity gradient, and between seasons. We studied the variations in home-range size of black-tailed tree rats by radiotracking in winter 2006, 2007 and summer 2007 at three study sites along an aridity gradient in southern Africa. Home ranges were estimated using 100\% and 95\% minimum convex polygons (MCP) and 95\% and 50\% fixed kernels. Home ranges varied widely, from 166 to 80 199 m2 for males and from 46 to 8810 m2 for females. Males had larger home ranges than females, which supports a promiscuous mating system reported for the species. Although range size was reduced in both sexes in winter, this was not significant. We found no significant difference in home-range size along the aridity gradient. It is suggested that a combination of habitat productivity, season and breeding system influences the size of home range and that this species displays phenotypic flexibility in terms of its behavioural responses to these factors.},

Little has been published about the historical biogeography and diversification factors in members of this genus. Here we examined, using molecular data, the evolutionary relationships, and species boundaries within a species complex of Eliurus and the role of rivers in their evolution. Specifically, we tested the hypothesized monophyly of E. antsingy (west) and the recently described E. carletoni (north) using two mitochondrial genes, cytochrome It, the control region, and a nuclear marker, the Interstitial Retinol Binding Protein (IRBP). We also assessed the species boundaries of E. carletoni and examined phylogeographic patterns using two mitochondrial markers and an extensive geographic sampling. Molecular data show that members of the E. antsingy and E. carletoni complex together form a monophyletic group. Although samples provisionally assigned to E. carletoni based on morphological characters from different sites in northern Madagascar cluster in three separate phylogroups, they are monophyletic and assignable to this species. Rivers do not act as strict barriers to dispersal in E. carletoni. The demonstrated monophyly of both E. antsingy and E. carletoni contributes to the amounting evidence for a biogeographic link between the north and western regions of the island.

In this article, we describe two new subfossil species of rodent: Brachytarsomys mahajambaensis, the smallest within the genus and Nesomys narindaensis, the largest within the genus. Most of the extant species of these two genera live in the tropical rainforests of the eastern and north-eastern areas of Madagascar, far away from the north-western part of the island where a dry deciduous forest occurs.

Until this study, the closest known populations in southern Africa were separated by nearly 2000 km from the closest populations in the Albertine Rift Valley. Here we document previously unknown populations of Myosorex, representing two new endemic taxa from montane forests adjacent to the Albertine Rift. In conjunction with additional data from Malawi, we fill in major gaps in our knowledge of the biodiversity and distribution of this genus in the areas of the Albertine and Malawi Rift Valleys. We demonstrate that this gap is an artefact of survey effort and collecting serendipity. The two new species described herein, as well as other species of Myosorex from north of the Zambezi River, exhibit limited distributions and are confined to montane habitats, typically above 1000 m. Our new species of Myosorex from Kahuzi-Biega NP (DRC) is the second known species of Myosorex from that park where it is syntopic with Myosorex babaulti. This is the first time that two species of Myosorex co-occur in any forest north of the Zambezi River. This suggests either sympatric speciation or a secondary re-invasion during times of climatic amelioration and forest expansion. The two species described here (Myosorex jejei and Myosorex bururiensis) are associated with two phenetically-defined species groups: the former with a more narrow hexagon-shaped skull, long-tail, and short claws ('narrow-headed group') and the latter with a more broad hexagon-shaped skull, short tail and long claws ('broad-headed group').},

The levels of species replacement ([beta]-diversity) are evaluated along these three different longitudinal gradients. Twenty-two sites were inventoried, six along the Soahany River, five along the Manambolo River, and 11 along the Mangoky River. Thirty-five species of small mammals were documented at these sites, composed of 21 species of endemic Afrosoricida (Tenrecidae); two species of Soricomorpha including one endemic (Suncus madagascariensis) and one introduced (S. murinus); and 12 species of Rodentia including 10 endemics (Nesomyidae) and two introduced species (Ratios rattus and Mus musculus). There was a correlation between species richness and the length of each river basin: Mangoky has the greatest species richness (29 taxa), followed by the Manambolo (11 taxa) and the Soahany (10 taxa). [alpha]-diversity augments with increasing habitat complexity and surface area. Humid forest sites in the central highlands near the Zomandao River (the source of the Mangoky) possess high [alpha]-diversity. For dry forest sites, those towards the interior in relatively large forested areas have greater [alpha]-diversity measures than those of smaller or coastal forest sites. [beta]-diversity augments along the river systems with increasing habitat heterogeneity. The transect along the Soahany River has the highest [beta]-diversity values, indicating higher levels of species turnover than the other two river systems.},

	abstract = {Mechanisms behind variation in physiological traits may assist in explaining how certain traits have evolved. The ability of mammals to concentrate urine has been seen as an adaptation to xeric environments. Urine osmolality and relative medullary thickness (RMT) are two indices which indicate urine concentrating powers. In addition, mammals living in xeric regions have lower water turnover rates (WTR) than their mesic counter-parts. The RMT, urine concentrating ability (UCA) and WTR of the Black-tailed Tree Rat, Thallomys nigricauda, were investigated at three study sites along an aridity gradient. We investigated the extent to which these traits are influenced by evolutionary adaptation and/or phenotypic flexibility. There was no significant difference in RMT between sites and no difference in osmolalities when site and season were taken into account In addition, there was no significant effect of site and season on WTR. This suggests that these traits might have a genetic basis, and reflect an evolutionary adaptation. Lack of differences in the renal traits in T. nigricauda across their range may be interpreted as lack of phenotypic flexibility. However, as a consequence of the degree of individual variation in the parameters measured there appears to be phenotypic flexibility with individuals responding to their specific conditions. This has positive implications for the survival of the species in the light of climate change. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

A total of 133 genetically determined specimens were used for the morphometric analyses. Statistical analyses clearly demonstrated that the three species largely overlapped in centroid size (M. erythroleucus tends to be larger on average than the M. huberti and M. natalensis) but they exhibited large differences in skull shape. The current study focused on skull shape, and allowed us to discriminate three morphological groups that are congruent with the three species suggested by molecular identification (90\% of the individuals are correctly assigned by cross-validated classifications). In the Mastomys, the evolution of cranial length and shape may be influenced by competitive pressure between closely related species separated by ecological segregation. This source of variability could possibly induce character displacement between species of Mastomys. To cite this article: A. Lalis et al., C. R. Biologies 332 (2009).

	volume = {288},
	issn = {0375-0442},
	abstract = {Mammalian fossils have been collected over several decades by teams associated with the Kenya National Museums from two sites ill northwestern Kenya, Losodok and Benson's Site. Geological work in the area has determined that Losodok is Late Oligocene in age (BOSCHETTO et al. 1992); only one mammal from Losodok has been previously discussed in light of the age determinations, a catarrhine primate (LEAKEY et al. 1995). In this paper, we describe the rest of the mammals known from these sites, which proves to be a fauna consisting of at least 21 species in eight orders. Recent field work during the summer of 2007 yielded more mammals from both of these sites; additional mammal localities were found near Benson's Site, prompting us to designate the new region Nakwal. Several mammalian species are shared between the Losodok sample and that from Nakwal, indicating that they are about the same age. The mammallan faunas are distinctly Oligocene in their taxonomic composition, consisting of African groups previously known from the Early Tertiary such as hyracoids, arsinortheres, primitive proboscideans, thryonomyold rodents, proviverrine and pterodontine creodonts, catarrhine Primates, and anthracotheres. immigrant mammals characteristic of the African Early Miocene are conspicuously absent except for a small true carnivore of the genus Mioprionodon, the earliest fossil record of Carnivora in Africa. We formally describe two new genera (Losodokodon, a proboscidean, and Mlanyama, a creodont), and 8 new species (of the genera Brachyhyrax, Thyrohrax, Meroechyrax, Diamantomys, Mioprionodon, and the two new genera). Several other species are informally described and discussed but not named in this paper, and we also make new comparisons regarding Kamoyapithecus, the only species from Losodok previously named (LEAKEY et al. 1995). The new fauna is transitional between earlier Oligocene mammal faunas of Africa (known from Ethiopia, Egypt, and several other countries) and the Early Miocene faunas of East Africa. Several taxa are morphological intermediates, and potential phylogentic links, between early Tertiary forms and Miocene taxa; these include the proboscidean Losodokodon and the primate Kamoyapithecus. Others represent the earliest record for African groups otherwise known in the Miocene (Brachyhyrax, Afrohyrax, Meroehyrax, Prodeinotherium, Diamantomys). Still others represent the latest occurrence of taxa previously known from the Early Tertiary (pachyhyracinc hyracoids, Thyrohyrax, Arsinoitherium). All taxa in the fauna represent forms that could have evolved in situ in Africa except for the new species of Mioprionodon, which is an immigrant from the north. The new discoveries highlight the fact that the faunal transition between archaic endemic mammals of the Early Tertiary and the more modern Neogene faunas occurred during a very short time interval at or near the Oligocene-Miocene boundary. We discuss the nature and importance of this transition, which we designate the African Mid-Tertiary Event (AMTE).},

	abstract = {As small arid-zone mammals, Cape ground squirrels (Xerus inauris) are unusual in being diurnally active. It is postulated that they remain active during the day by using their parasol-like tails to shade their bodies whilst foraging. However, no studies have continuously measured body temperature to determine the effect of using the tail as a parasol, relative to other thermoregulatory behaviours, such as burrow retreat. We caught four free-ranging Cape ground squirrels (673 [plus or minus] 36 g) and surgically implanted miniature temperature-sensitive data loggers into their abdomens, to record body temperature every 5 min to an accuracy of 0.04 [degree]C, before they were released back into their home range and observed for two weeks. Mean daily peak black globe temperature was 41 [degree]C, and daily peak body temperature reached 40 [degree]C. Ground squirrels raised their tails significantly more often at globe temperatures above 30 [degree]C, but raising the tail did not decrease body temperature, nor prevent body temperature rising. Ground squirrels retreated to burrows, at 18 [degree]C, significantly more often at high body temperatures and body temperature dropped 1-2 [degree]C before reemergence. We believe that the tail was raised to provide thermal comfort during high solar radiation exposure, and that burrow retreat was employed to dissipate a heat load and remain active diurnally.

	abstract = {A new species of Graphiurus, G. walterverheyeni, is described. It is represented by two young adults, a female (holotype) and male (paratype), obtained from two sites in the central Congo Basin, Democratic Republic of the Congo. The new species is the possible morphological and phylogenetic counterpart of G. crassicaudatus, endemic to West Africa. Although the new species resembles G. crassicaudatus in texture and coloration of pelage, along with certain derived cranial features, G. walterverheyni, n. sp., is separated not only by its much smaller body size as evidenced by the significant contrasts in external, cranial, and dental metrics between the two species, but also by proportional differences. The South Central faunal region of equatorial Africa (Grubb, 1978, 1982, 2001; Colyn, 1991; Colyn and Van Rompaey, 1994; Happold, 1996), and the Salonga-Lukenie-Sankuru landscape (Congo Basin Forest Partnership, 2006). identify the biogeographic landscape of G. walterverheyeni, n. sp. Scant habitat information associated with the specimens suggests that this Congo Basin endemic occurs in seasonally flooded tropical lowland forest formations. Two other species of Graphiurus, G. lorraineus and G. surdus, are broadly sympatric with the new species, but neither has been recorded from the two collection localities. Determining species diversity of sub-Saharan dormice embraces epidemiological concerns in addition to strictly taxonomic and biogeographic inquiries. The first documented outbreak of human monkeypox outside Africa occurred in the midwestern United States in 2003 and was associated with a shipment of captive mammals (Funisciurus sp., Heliosciurus sp., Cricetomys sp., Atherurus sp., Hybomys sp., and Graphiurus sp.) from Ghana (Guarner et. al., 2004). Following this outbreak, certain species of African dormice occurring in West and Central Africa are currently being scrutinized as possible hosts of monkeypox virus (Orthopoxviridae), which can produce a severe illness in humans resembling smallpox (Hutson et al., 2007; Levine et al., 2007). Understanding the ecology and epidemiology of this virus requires correct identification of mammalian host species so that accurate, relevant geographic and ecological data can be analyzed.},

	abstract = {Hybridization and introgression can have important consequences for the evolution, ecology and epidemiology of pathogenic organisms. We examined the dynamics of hybridization between a trematode parasite of humans, Schistosoma mansoni, and its sister species, S. rodhaini, a rodent parasite, in a natural hybrid zone in western Kenya. Using microsatellite markers, rDNA and mtDNA, we showed that hybrids between the two species occur in nature, are fertile and produce viable offspring through backcrosses with S. mansoni. Averaged across collection sites, individuals of hybrid ancestry comprised 7.2\% of all schistosomes collected, which is a large proportion given that one of the parental species, S. rodhaini, comprised only 9.1\% of the specimens. No F1 individuals were collected and all hybrids represented backcrosses with S. mansoni that were of the first or successive generations. The direction of introgression appears highly asymmetric, causing unidirectional gene flow from the rodent parasite, S. rodhaini, to the human parasite, S. mansoni. Hybrid occurrence was seasonal and most hybrids were collected during the month of September over a 2-year period, a time when S. rodhaini was also abundant. We also examined the sex ratios and phenotypic differences between the hybrids and parental species, including the number of infective stages produced in the snail host and the time of day the infective stages emerge. No statistical differences were found in any of these characteristics, and most of the hybrids showed an emergence pattern similar to that of S. mansoni. One individual, however, showed a bimodal emergence pattern that was characteristic of both parental species. In conclusion, these species maintain their identity despite hybridization, although introgression may cause important alterations of the biology and epidemiology of schistosomiasis in this region.},

Foraging efficiency was determined by measuring the remaining food in artificial food patches (giving-up densities: GUDs) from two experiments. in the first experiment, we placed patches in different microhabitat types (cover vs open) and at varying distances from cover. This experiment was conducted during three moon stages (waxing, full, waning). We found that the rodents had higher GUDs (lower foraging efficiency) in the open microhabitat. The distance from nearest shelter had a marginally significant positive effect on GUDs. GUDs were higher in both microhabitat types during the waxing and full phases, but decreased sharply once the moon began to rise after sunset. These results are likely due to higher predation risk away from cover and in more illuminated environments. In the second experiment, we examined mouse responses to seeds impregnated with plant toxins. Seeds impregnated with oxalic acid were avoided by the rodents, while seeds soaked in tannic acid did not differ significantly from control seeds. Our results highlight important ecological factors affecting the foraging behaviour of these rodents.},

Nineteen environmental variables submitted to a Principal Components Analysis selected those variables with higher factor loadings, which represent the main environmental conditions of the Northern African region (temperature in the coldest quarter, seasonal temperature, precipitation in the coldest quarter, temperature in the wettest quarter). After selecting hundred times more pseudo-absence points than presence observations (n = 6600 at a 0.083[degree] resolution), Generalized Additive Models and Single-hidden-layer Neural Networks fitted in R were used to calibrate the model. Model results were extrapolated for the Canary Islands and the western Mediterranean region. In order to select between the two techniques, we calculated three accuracy measures (specificity, sensitivity and AUC) after using a Jack-knifing procedure and models were repeated ten times. The GAM model was less accurate than the NN model. Suitable areas did not have mean temperatures in the coldest quarter lower than -5[degree]C and precipitation in the coldest quarter higher than 300 mm, respectively. We predicted favorable climatic areas across almost all the Maghreb, the European western Mediterranean region and in all the Canary Islands. Nevertheless, the seven islands differed significantly in the mean favorability scores, with El Hierro, Lanzarote and Gran Canaria being the most suitable. Same methodological analysis was applied to predict A. getulus distribution in other Canarian islands based on presence data from the invaded Fuerteventura. In this case, only Lanzarote and Gran Canaria appeared to be climatically suitable for the species. Our predictive model is an applicable tool to establish the invasive potential of A. getulus and to prioritize management strategies, within and outside the Canarian archipelago, to impede the expansion of this invasive squirrel out of Fuerteventura Island.},

However, the taxonomy and biogeography of the western pygmy mice are poorly known, as this genus contains many cryptic species. To improve our taxonomic knowledge on this subgenus and its distribution range in West Africa, we performed a molecular, cytogenetical and morphological study of all Mus ( Nannomys) species in this part of Africa. This approach allowed us to detect five species in Guinea (Mus mattheyi, M. minutoides, M. setulosus, M. baoulei, M. musculoides) and four ( M. minutoides, M. setulosus, M. baoulei, M. musculoides) in Ivory Coast. Our molecular results confirm the validity of M. baoulei and the extended distribution range of M. mattheyi. We also observed a high degree of genetic differentiation between and within these species, especially within the M. setulosus clade which may be a species complex. The canonical analyses on the craniometrical and external morphological features of the sequenced specimens are insufficient to perfectly separate the studied species. Nevertheless, our results confirm that M. setulosus and M. baoulei are the largest Mus species that occur in Guinea and Ivory Coast. M. baoulei can be distinguished by its short tail and M. setulosus by an enlarged and bilobated lower molar (M3). Among the smaller species, M. musculoides is difficult to identify using morphological data alone, but differences in tail length proportions, size of tympanic bullae, the length and shape of the upper dental row allow identification of this species with some confidence. Our results allow us to provide some conclusions about the distribution ranges of the studied Mus (Nannomys) spp. in both countries and to discuss their presence in relation to vegetation, habitat and human settlements.},

	abstract = {In grassland systems across the globe, ecologists have been attempting to understand the complex role of fire, grazing and rainfall in creating habitat heterogeneity and the consequences of anthropogenic control of these factors on ecosystem integrity and functioning. Using a South African grassland ecosystem as a model, we investigated the impact of fire and grazing pressure on small mammal communities during three differing periods of a rainfall cycle. Over 2 years, 15,203 trap nights revealed 1598 captures of 11 species (nine rodents, one macroscelid and one insectivore). Results highlighted the importance of the interplay between factors and showed that the role of fire, grazing and rainfall in determining small mammal abundance was species-dependant. While no two species were affected by the same environmental variables, grass cover or height was important to 56\% of species. Considered independently, high rainfall had a positive influence on small mammal abundance and diversity, although the lag period in population response was species-specific. High grazing negatively affected overall abundance, but specifically in Mastomys coucha; fire alone had little immediate impact on small mammal diversity. Six months after the fire, vegetation cover had recovered to similar levels as unburned areas, although small mammal diversity and richness were higher in burned areas than unburned areas. Grazing levels influenced the rate of vegetation recovery. In conclusion, low-level grazing and burning can help to maintain small mammal biodiversity, if conducted under appropriate rainfall levels. A too high grazing pressure, combined with fire, and/or fire conducted under drought conditions can have a negative impact on small mammal biodiversity. To maintain small mammal diversity in grassland ecosystems, the combined effects of the previous year's rainfall and existing population level as well as the inhibition of vegetation recovery via grazing pressure need to be taken into consideration before fire management is applied.},

	abstract = {The Cape ground squirrel Xerus inauris is unusual among social mammals as it exhibits a low reproductive skew, being a facultative plural breeder with not all females breeding within a group. We investigated pituitary function to assess whether there was reproductive inhibition at the level of the pituitary and potentially the hypothalamus in breeding and non-breeding female Cape ground squirrels. We did so during the summer and winter periods by measuring luteinizing hormone (LH) responses to single doses of 2g exogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and physiological saline administered to 42 females from II colonies. Basal LH concentrations of females increased in response to the GnRH challenge. Basal plasma LH concentrations were greater during winter, when most oestrus events are observed. However, we found no differences in plasma LH concentrations between breeding and non-breeding females. We showed that the anterior pituitary of non-breeding female ground squirrels is no less sensitive to exogenously administered GnRH than that of breeding females. We therefore concluded that the pituitary is no more active in breeding than non-breeding females. The lack of differentiation in response to GnRH suggests that either non-breeding females have ovaries that are less sensitive to LH or that they refrain from sexual activity with males through an alternative mechanism of self-restraint.},

	abstract = {Our earlier chromosome banding studies of Acomys cahirinus and Acomys dimidiatus (the latter long considered to be a subspecies of the former) revealed that, despite very close diploid numbers (36 vs. 38), these taxa possess sharply different karyotypes and undoubtedly belong to different species. In this context, the taxonomic status and the relationship between the two chromosomal forms in Sinai (2n = 36) and Israel (2n = 38), chromosomally homozygous across a vast range except for a very narrow hybrid zone, remain poorly documented. Neither of these forms have previously been studied by chromosome banding; thus, the exact nature of chromosomal differences as well as the species to which these forms should be assigned remain unknown. Here, we present the data on comparative G-banding analysis and morphometrics of Acomys from Israel, Sinai, and Saudi Arabia, and a hybrid obtained in laboratory crosses between latter two. The analysis revealed that karyotype of Acomys from Israel is identical to that of Acomys from Saudi Arabia and both are different from that of Acomys from Sinai by one Robertsonian fusion. Therefore, karyotypically, all three are very different from A. cahirinus. It follows from the study that Sinai and probably Arabian peninsula and Minor Asia must be excluded from geographical distribution of A. cahirinus, which is limited from West Sahara to Egypt along Nile river (except Sinai). Furthermore, the synthesis of chromosomal and recent molecular data suggests a phylogeographical scenario explaining the modern distribution of Acomys in the Sinai and Arabian peninsulas and permits the update of the taxonomic status of these populations.

	abstract = {One way to avoid potential predators is to be sensitive to odour cues, particularly those in faeces and urine, left by predators. This sensitivity has been demonstrated in many solitary, nocturnal, small mammals which may fall victim to ambush predators. We tested the response of Cape ground squirrels, a diurnal, group-living small mammal, to the presence of predator (black-backed jackal) faeces and non-predator (black wildebeest) dung in baited traps, and also predator faeces and non-predator dung outside their burrows. The squirrels showed a significantly higher avoidance of traps scented with predator faeces than both control and non-predator dung-scented traps. They also took significantly longer to emerge from burrows that had predator faeces outside compared with control burrows and burrows with non-predator dung outside and showed a trend for higher vigilance once they emerged from burrows with predator faeces outside. We argue that as diurnal group-living reduces a reliance on olfactory cues, this species is more likely to rely on visual cues and the vigilance of other individuals than nocturnal solitary species that have been the focus of most studies up till now. As a result, squirrels very quickly return to normal behaviour after exposure to a predator cue. Level of sociality is likely to influence responses to olfactory cues of predators and should be the focus of further studies.},

Our study revealed that 17 rearrangements comprising seven fissions, five translocations and five inversions occurred in the evolution of this group, with 1 - 13 rearrangements differentiating the various species. In addition the unusually large sex chromosomes appear to be species- specific as judged by size and morphology reflecting structural rearrangements as well as the variable presence of a large amount of C-heterochromatin found in each species at a particular chromosomal location. These karyotypic features allow us to recognize five distinct species in West Africa ( compared to the two recognized in recent taxonomic lists) and to roughly delimit their geographical distributions. The pattern of phylogenetic relationships inferred from a cladistic analysis of the chromosomal data is in good agreement with recent molecular phylogenetic studies that recognize a West African species group within the genus Gerbilliscus, and the monophyly of both Gerbilliscus and Gerbillurus.

	abstract = {The genus Arvicanthis Lesson, 1842 (Rodentia; Muridae; Murinae) comprises herbivorous unstriped grass rats widespread in the Nile Valley and West, Central and East Africa. Two species (A. niloticus and A. testicularis) have previously been reported to occur in the Nile Valley but with many taxonomic uncertainties. This investigation was aimed at clarifying the systematic position of these two putative species in Sudan by using cytogenetic data and random amplification of polymorphic DNA (PCR-RAPDs) fragments. Karyological comparisons of the two putative species, captured in six different regions of Sudan, revealed the existence of one species, A. niloticus, with a diploid number of 2n = 62 and N.F.A = 62, identical to karyotyped populations from northeastern Africa (Egypt and Ethiopia), which belong to the known cytotype ANI-1a. The PCR-RAPD protocol used in this study was shown to be consistent, reproducible and highly informative. Analysis of the genetic profiles of samples showed no separation of Arvicanthis individuals into "species" or populations (divergence range = 0.05 - 0.19\%). Furthermore, t-tests revealed that intra-population divergences were significantly higher than inter-population values (two-tailed t-test for unequal variances; 0.001 {\textless} P {\textless} 0.05), indicating that genetic variation is not structured geographically. The data obtained from the two systematic methods suggest the absence of reproductive isolation and it therefore appears more appropriate to consider Arvicanthis from Sudan to represent a single species, namely A. niloticus.},

	volume = {21},
	issn = {0932-9153},
	abstract = {In the 19th, and at the beginning of the 20th century, Collared Flycatchers Ficedula albicollis Were probably always sparsely distributed in SW Germany. In the state and communal forests of Baden-Wuerttemberg, the rise in the number of nest boxes from 0 to over 200.000 in the 25 years after 1950 triggered an enormous population increase to about 5.000-7.000 breeding pairs. A slight rise in numbers had already been recorded obviously due to the high numbers of cold winters in the period 1930-1971. since the resulting decline in competing species benefited the Collared Flycatcher. With stagnation in the number of boxes the population began to decline. The population increase in meadow orchards was similar and was perhaps influenced by the high population increase in woodland. But while there was only a temporary drop in the meadow orchard population due to climatic factors in Africa (Sahel drought) in 1970-1990, the forest population has almost disappeared. The factors suggested as possible causes of the population fall since ca. 1975 included an "Atlanticisation" of the breeding season climate in Central Europe, the effects of toxic substances used in forests and meadow orchards, the grubbing up of fruit trees, or the loss of mature forest stands. None of these factors appears to have played a decisive role in the drop in numbers. Although mature tree stands, and therefore natural cavities, have increased over the last 50 years, the flycatcher nearly disappeared from woodland. However the ca. 5 million nest box records from the forests of Baden-Wurttemberg highlight a phenomenon that until now has been almost ignored. This population decrease in woodland has, for over 20 years, run counter to the increase in the numbers of the Edible Dormouse Glis glis. Around 1950, this species occupied between 2 and 7 \% of nest boxes: today that figure is 20-30 \%, but regionally can be well above 70 \%. During the first 25 years of nest box monitoring, Edible Dormice found in nest boxes were killed. While this dormouse's active period hardly overlaps with the breeding season of tits Parus spp. and Nuthatch Sitta europaea, it clashes completely with that of the flycatcher. Through competition for nest boxes and predation on birds. both young and adults, it has become the dominant factor. Following an "Edible Dormouse year" there are Ficedula albicollis population declines in the two subsequent years. leading in the medium-term to elimination of subpopulations and a reduction in breeding range. Declining interest in the hunting of Red Foxes Vulpes vulpes, plus oral vaccination against rabies, have led to a huge rise in the fox population. In forests this has meant a reduction in the numbers of martens Martes spp., even though they are also hunted less, which in turn has profited the Edible Dormouse. Now increasing numbers of competitors in the forests are diminishing the supply of cavities. Of all successful breeding attempts by birds, the percentage represented by Collared Flycatcher in the forests of SW Germany fell from regional values of 3-30 \% to present-day levels that can barely be measured. Only a local trial since 1999 to encourage flycatchers in the forests by preventing the settlement and reproduction of Edible Dormouse has resulted in a strong improvement in Ficedula albicollis numbers, and its share of all successful birds breeding in nest boxes rose (despite unfavourable climatic developments at 700 m a.s.l.) from an average of below 2 \% to 33 \%. The almost complete exclusion of a single competitor/predator has therefore led to a substantial in-crease in the Collared Flycatcher population. The Edible Dormouse, which is uncommon away from woodland, is almost certainly the chief cause for the disappearance of Collared Flycatchers from SW-German forests, which, with their increasingly semi natural management regime and their rising mast crop, are proving to be an ecological trap for the species. Also their preference for alluvial woodland might be explained by the fact that dormice that hibernate underground are drowned. So what can be singled-out here over the past 70 years is that the weight given to the dominant factors affecting Collared Flycatcher numbers at different times has frequently altered: Periods with an above average number of cold winters decimated competing cavity-breeders like tits and Nuthatch between 1930 and 1970. From 1950 to 1970 the erection of a huge number of nest boxes and the killing of Edible Dormice resulted in Collared Flycatcher being a common woodland bird species. Simultaneously, toxic substances in the environment have apparently affected predators (Sparrow hawk Accipiter nisus) and cavity-competitors (wasps, hornets, bats; Vespidae, Chiroptera) more than the flycatcher, and hence it has even becoming re-established in woodlands. Studies confirm this (Tab. 2), but also show that the former high numbers of this flycatcher were artificially maintained. The strong recovery trend in flycatcher numbers since the 1990s were only seen in the meadow orchards. where the species profited from the decline of its cavity-competitors Tree Spar-row Passer montanus and Starling Sturnus vulgaris and the absence of Edible Dormice.},

The more humid site (Tabora B) in the northern part of Serengeti had the highest diversity of rodents followed by the Mihale site at the western extension. The driest site at Robanda had the lowest overall species diversity. Diversity also varied between the three levels of conservation status whereby the UA had the least diversity while the NP, which enjoyed the highest level of conservation status, had the highest diversity of rodents. Unprotected Area and NP plots at Tabora B showed a rodent species similarity index of 40\%; all the other paired plots scored over 50\% similarity indices, suggesting that, within a site, species composition did not vary significantly between the three levels of conservation status. The Robanda site had the highest (56\%) overall abundance of rodents; Mihale and Tabora B sites had about the same level of rodent abundance (20 and 24\% respectively). For the Mihale site, Mastomys natalensis ranked first followed by Arvicanthis niloticus and Tatera robusta, each of which contained 40, 38 and 16\%, respectively, of all individuals caught at the site.

	abstract = {This paper investigates the usefulness of two mitochondrial genes (16S rRNA and cytochrome b) to solve taxonomical difficulties within the genus Hylomyscus and to infer its evolutionary history. Both genes proved to be suitable molecular markers for diagnosis of B Hylomyscus species. Nevertheless the resolving powers of these two genes differ, and with both markers (either analyzed singly or in combination), some nodes remain unresolved. This is probably related to the fact that the species emerged during a rapid diversification event that occurred 2-6 Myr ago (4-5 Myr ago for most divergence events). Our molecular data support the recognition of an "aeta" group, while the "alleni'" and "parvus" groups are not fully supported. Based on tree topology and genetic divergence, two taxa generally recognized as subspecies should be elevated at the species level (H. simus and H. cf kaimosae). H. stella populations exhibit ancient haplotype segregation that may represent currently unrecognized allopatric species. The existence of cryptic species within H. parvus is questioned. Finally, three potentially new species may occur in West Central Africa. The Congo and Oubangui Rivers, as well as the Volta and Niger Rivers and/or the Dahomey gap could have formed effective barriers to Hylomyseus species dispersal, favoring their speciation in allopatry. The pronounced shifts in African climate during the late Pliocene and Miocene, which resulted in major changes in the distribution and composition of the vegetation, could have promoted speciation within the genus (refuge theory). Future reports should focus on the geographic distribution of Hylomyscus species in order to get a better understanding of the evolutionary history of the genus. [copyright] 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Pitfall traps were more efficient (higher number of species trapped and higher trap success) than baited traps for capturing shrews. In contrast, they were less efficient for capturing rodents, even if some rare species were captured in pitfall traps only. Sherman and snap traps have complementary qualities for the capture of rodents. Sherman traps are more effective for trapping smaller rodent species, while snap traps tend to be more effective for trapping larger ones. Moreover, light individuals of the largest species are better captured than heavy ones in Sherman, while no significant difference was observed for small species. No sex ratio difference was detected between populations sampled by each of the three types of traps. The three types of traps used in this study have complementary effects onto the capture of small mammals in African rainforest. An assortment of traps should always be employed in studies of small mammal communities in African rainforest in order to obtain a wider range of taxa, and thus a better representation of the community.},

Since the mid eighties of the last century the distribution of this species, classically identified in the center-south of Italy and in Sicily, has been in rapid expansion northwards and it now occupies completely new territories. It is presently distributed in a more or less homogeneous manner along the Po Basin side of the Apennines, in the provinces of Modena, Parma, Rimini and Reggio Emilia. It has recently been observed north of the Po River in Lombardy and the Veneto area and towards the west in Liguria and Piedmont.

	abstract = {The palaeontological site of Hoedjiespunt 1 (HDPI) has been dated to the late Middle Pleistocene. The rich mammalian fauna, recovered from the site, including four hominid teeth, is believed to have been accumulated by a hyaena. Micromammals were recovered from within the same horizons as the macro fauna. Previous analyses of the micromammals from the hyaena lair did not include a taphonomic analysis, and the agent of accumulation was assumed to be the hyaena responsible for the accumulation of the larger mammals. This assumption had not, however; been verified by a taphonomic analysis of the micromammal assemblages. A taxonomic and taphonomic study was thus carried out on the HDPI micromammals in order to identify the predator(s) or agents responsible for the micromammal accumulation, and to evaluate the suitability of the assemblage for palacoenvironmental analysis. The general pattern of species distribution of the murids from the two main fossil-bearing horizons at Hoedjiespunt I suggests that the micromammals have come from the same, original assemblage. The similarity observed in the micromammal taxonomy of these horizons is echoed in the taphonomy. The digestion on prey incisors, together with the range and activity patterns of prey species, suggests that the predator responsible for the fossil accumulation was a barn owl. The assemblage may provide a brief window into the micromammal population living on the west coast, in the immediate vicinity of the site, during the late Middle Pleistocene.},

Using radio-tracking and direct observation, a population of nokis in Namibia was intermittently studied over 3 years to document their basic natural history. Temperature loggers and temperature-sensitive radio tags were used to determine that nokis do not have a labile body temperature and do not go into daily torpor. They spend nights deep in rock crevices, but seemingly do not build or use nests. During the cool winter months they bask in the sun at sunrise, and during the heat of the day they shelter in cool rock crevices. During the warm part of the year they bask less frequently. Because nokis have a low relative metabolic rate and a diet of seasonally poor-quality forage, their frequent use of solar basking and passive heat gain and loss from the massive rocks in their habitat is probably related to conservation of energy.},

	abstract = {A description is given of Psittacobrosus bechsteini n. sp. (Menoponidae sensu lato) from a female individual removed from a skin of the Cuban Macaw Ara tricolor, a Cuban endemic extinct since the 19th century. This find provided an opportunity to recall the relationship between ornithology and parasitology established by JOHANN MATTHAEUS BECHSTEIN (1757-1822) at the end of the 18th century. With regard to the listing of (4) scientific animal names created in honour of J. M. BECHSTEIN, it is argued here why the name of the small lepidopteran (Bucculatricidae). 'Bucculatrix bechsteinella (BECHSTEIN \& SCHARFENBERG, 1805)' should be revised as Bucculatrix bechsteinella (SCHARFENBERG in BECHSTEIN \& SCHARFENBERG, 1805). An annotated list identifies the animal louse species regarded as definitely or probably extinct up to the present day, as well as their hosts. It has been claimed that six fossil finds that are dealt with here are all animal lice. in actual fact, this applies to the following three records only: 1. Imagines of Neohaematopinus relictus DUBININ, 1948 (Anoplura, Polyplacidae) ex Spermolegus (Urocitellus) glacialis (VINOGRADOV) (Rodentia, Sciuridae), Pleistocene (ca. 10 000 years old), Yakutskaya. 2. Several eggs of an unknown animal louse (Anoplura ?) on hairs probably from a sciurid-like rodent (Rodentia), Baltic amber, Eocene (ca. 40 million years old), Germany. 3. An imago of Megamenopon rasnitsyni WAPPLER, SMITH \& DALGLEISH, 2003 (Amblycera, Menoponidae sensu lato) perhaps from a procellariiform, charadriiform or anseriform bird. Eocene (40 million years old), Germany. The Cretaceous Saurodectes vrsanskyi RASNITSYN \& ZHERIKHIN, 1999, a presumed ectoparasite on hair-covered pterosaurs, did not belong to the Phthiraptera but to another insect order. Recent (probably) extinct animal lice from mammals are apparently as yet unknown, but in contrast, apart from Psittacobrosus bechsteini n. sp., the following 11 species are known that once parasitized birds. In order of their first description they are: 1. Acutifrons caracarensis (KELLOGG \& MANN, 1912) (lschnocera, Philopteridae s.l.) ex Caracara lutosa (RIDGWAY) (Falconidae).

Philopteridae s.l.) ex Xenicus l. longipes (J. F. GMELIN) (Acanthisittidae), New Zealand. Further unnamed forms await their description, or their discovery on hosts that have become extinct during the last 400 years. Historical animal louse records are known from: 1.

In North-castern Tanzania, species composition is diverse and includes Mastomys natalensis, Lophuromys flavopunctatus, Grammomys dolichurus, Arvicanthis nairobae, Praomys delectorum and Mus sp.. Five species were recorded in South-western Tanzania namely, M. natalensis, Graphiurus murinus, Saccostomus elegans, Tatera leucogaster and Steatomys pratensis. In Central Tanzania M. natalensis was dominant, but a few Lemniscomys griselda were captured. Rodent abundance fluctuations were distinctively seasonal, especially for M. natalensis in the three localities and T. leucogaster in South-west Tanzania. In North-eastern Tanzania, L. flavopunctatus, G dolichurus, A. nairobae and P delectorum had low, but relatively stable Populations throughout the year. Ill South-west Tanzania, population peaks of M. natalensis and T leucogaster were reached in the dry season (June-September). In Central Tanzania, breeding of M natalensis was seasonal, with highest population abundance during July-November. Female M. natalensis were reproductively active in January-May and males had scrotal testes in December-June. No males were sexually active during July-November. Female T leucogaster in South-western Tanzania were reproductively active during November-April/May whereas sexually active males appeared in the Population during November-March. In view of the observed rodent population fluctuations and breeding patterns, recommendations are given for pragmatic rodent control in South-west and Central Tanzania and for plague in North-eastern Tanzania.},

	abstract = {West African gerbils of the genus Taterillus constitute a complex of seven sibling species distributed from sudano-guinean to saharo-sahelian regions. They display radically rearranged karyotypes despite low genic divergence and a very recent differentiation, that is, within the last 0.4 Myr for the six most derived species. We here provide a comparison of the seven specific karyotypes and perform a cladistic analysis using chromosomal rearrangements character states. When a posteriori polarized mutations were mapped onto the phylogenetic tree, 38 rearrangements were identified as fixed during the evolution of these rodents. This makes Taterillus one of the most striking examples of accelerated chromosomal evolution within placental mammals. Taking into account the types of chromosomal changes involved, divergence times between lineages, genetic distances, as well as reassessed geographic distributions, we suggest that ( 1) speciation in West African Taterillus was driven by chromosomal changes, and ( 2) the paleoclimatic oscillations of the Sahara desert have played a major role in their evolution. In particular, elevated plasticity of the Taterillus genome, as suggested by the patterns observed for some repetitive elements, would have led to a higher probability of mutation. We hypothesize that the process underpinning cladogenesis most probably involved highly underdominant genomic rearrangements that were fixed following pronounced populational bottlenecks resulting from drastic climatic and subsequent environmental changes. Major African rivers formed significant barriers to dispersal, limiting expansion during the more moist and so favorable periods. This scenario would explain the current parapatric species distributions and their relationship to the West African hydrographic features.},

	abstract = {A growing number of studies indicate that females can increase the viability of their offspring by gaining direct benefits such as parental care or genetic advantages through selective mating with certain males. Among the best candidates for the genetic basis of mate choice in vertebrates are the genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) because these highly polymorphic genes may increase offspring viability and provide direct cues for mate choice. A free-ranging, pair-living rodent was used as an example to investigate MHC-dependent mate choice in an obligate monogamous species, the Malagasy giant jumping rat Hypogeomys antimena. Two possible mechanisms of mate choice were tested. First, mate choice may occur to increase the heterozygosity of MHC genes in the progeny and, second, mates might choose each other according to the degree of dissimilarity of their functional MHC DRB (exon 2) proteins in order to maximise the allelic divergence in their offspring. Analyses of 65 Hypogeomys couples failed to confirm associations of mating patterns with the MHC genotype to increase heterozygosity or MHC allelic divergence in the progeny. Also, no evidence for mechanisms to increase the allelic divergence was found in sex-specific analyses where a male or female, respectively, migrated to and was accepted by a territory and burrow holder of the opposite sex. However, the frequency distribution of 0, 1 or 2 new alleles potentially available for the progeny differed significantly when a new male was chosen by a territory-holding female. In contrast to current models, genetically similar instead of dissimilar mates seem to be the preferred choice. This is the first study investigating the role of the MHC in mate selection in an obligate monogamous rodent.},

The present paper follows Vernon ( 1972) and Grindley et al. ( 1973) in eliciting information from material in Barn owl Tyto alba (Scopoli) pellets. Analyses are based on identified and counted mandibles and maxillae. The Laminate vlei rat, Otomys laminatus Thomas and Schwann, and Krebs's fat mouse, Steatomys krebsii Peters, are shown to have wider distributions than were previously recorded. The Southern multimammate mouse, Mastomys coucha ( A. Smith), is apparently expanding its range westwards, a move probably enabled by changes in vegetation due to farming practices. There appears to be some correspondence between proportional representation of some species and rainfall, either its amount per annum or its seasonality. Variation in alveolar length in Cape gerbils, Tatera afra ( Gray), taken as a proxy for mean individual mass, suggests that mean size in this species may be influenced by rainfall seasonality. Although the Vlei rat, Otomys irroratus (Brants), is known to breed throughout the year, the present evidence indicates that in the West Coast National Park births peak in late spring and early summer, some two months after maximum rainfall. The Western Cape data support the concept that T. alba is a selective opportunist. Sample structure and co-occurrence of species in individual pellets both show that in some cases the owls are more nearly opportunistic while in others they appear to be considerably more selective.},

From 18 pigs sampled in the same locations as the patients, PCR showed a high proportion of mixed infections of T. brucei s. l. and T. congolense riverine-forest. Zymodemes of T. brucei s. l. from these pigs were different from those found in humans. From a total of 16 260 captured tsetse (Glossina palpalis palpalis), 1701 were dissected and 28\%, were found to be infected by trypanosomes. The most prevalent trypanosome was T. congolense riverine-forest type, followed by T. Vivax, T. brucei s. l. and T. congolense savannah type, this latter being associated to the forest type of T. congolense in most cases. Mixed infections by 2 or 3 of these trypanosomes were also found. Use of a microsatellite marker allowed us to distinguish T. b. gambiense group I in some of the mature infections in tsetse. Differences in infection rates and in trypanosome genotypes according to the host might indicate that the pig malt not be an active animal reservoir for humans in this focus.},

	abstract = {Aim We investigated the patterns of body-size changes of the north-western Mediterranean Plio-Pleistocene large mammal faunas (excluding rodents, bats, lagomorphs and insectivores) in order to identify the tempo and mode of the major shifts in body size distribution, and to put them in the context of Plio-Pleistocene environmental changes and the development of the Mediterranean climate. Location. We analysed fossil faunas of Spain, France and Italy. A set of recent regional faunas from several macroclimatic regions was selected to serve as elements for comparison of the size distribution of past faunas, consisting of: Spain, France and Italy together, Florida, California, Central Chile, Indochina, India, Korea-Manchuria, Malawi, The Cape, North Africa, Turkey and Australia. Methods. Mammal species were grouped into five body size categories for carnivores and four categories for noncarnivore species. The number of species in each size category was computed and the resulting matrix of body weight classes X regions and time intervals was used as an input matrix in a Correspondence Analysis. Results. Recent and fossil faunas strongly differ in body size structure. The distribution of recent faunas within the CA seems to reflect both ecological and historic factors, intertwined in a complex fashion. No clear relationship has been observed between body size structure and environmental factors. During the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene there were only minor changes in the pattern of size distribution, although plant communities were in a transition process from subtropical forests to Mediterranean woodlands and steppes. The major change in body size structure of the north-western Mediterranean fauna occurred at the Galerian, around 1 Ma ago. This marked the beginning of the modern fauna, and a general trend towards a larger body size, reduction in the number of medium sized herbivores, and an increase of large herbivores and megaherbivores. Main conclusions. The Plio-Pleistocene faunas lack modern analogues. The body size structure of mammalian regional faunas appears to be strongly dependent on historical factors. The only major shift in body size distribution occurred during the Plio-Pleistocene, in the late Villaftanchian-Galerian transition, coincident with the onset of the Pleistocene high intensity glacial cycles.},

Although morphologically very similar, they exhibit considerable chromosomal diversity which is here confirmed and extended by the G-banding analysis of 65 mice from West and South Africa. On the basis of their karyotype and distribution area, the specimens were assigned to at least five species. Extensive differentiation both within and between species was observed that involved almost exclusively Robertsonian translocations, 23 of which are newly described. Two of the rearrangements were sex chromosome-autosome translocations, associated in some cases with partial deletions of the X or Y chromosomes. Several authors have predicted that the highly deleterious effect of this rearrangement would be reduced if the sex and autosomal segments were insulated by a block of centromeric heterochromatin. The C-banding analyses performed showed that among the species carrying X-autosome translocations, one followed the expected pattern, while the other did not. In this case, functional isolation of the sex and autosome compartments must involve other repetitive sequences or genomic traits that require further molecular characterization. Such studies will provide insight into the causes and consequences of the high diversity of sex chromosome rearrangements in this subgenus.},

For the most abundant species (Hylomyscus stella, Hybomys univittatus, Heimyscus fumosus, and Praomys cf. misonnei), a general unimodal trend in trap success was detected, owing to variations in breeding activity and survival, with a minimum around the long rainy season and a maximum either during the short rainy season or at the beginning of the following long dry season. These fluctuations varied in magnitude among species, and seasonal variations in relative abundance were recorded. Our results support the assumption that in the tropics, rainfall and associated patterns of fruit and insect abundance are important factors which may act directly or indirectly to initiate breeding activity so that lactation occurs at a time of greatest food abundance. Finally, intrapopulational differences in age at sexual maturity were found, both between the sexes and among individuals of the same sex.},

	abstract = {We briefly review the primate-bearing Pondaung mammal fauna (Eocene, Myanmar). The age of the Pondaung fauna has been determined as latest middle Eocene based on the radiometric (fission-track) dates analyzed recently. The Pondaung fauna consists of six orders of mammals, including 22 genera and 29 species. Among the 22 genera, more than half (12 genera) are endemic to this fauna. Although both artiodactyls and perissodactyls are abundant, the former is less diversified in familial and generic numbers than the latter, but is slightly more dominant in collection size [in particular, Anthracotherium (Artiodactyla; Anthracotheriidae) has been most dominantly collected from the field]. This suggests the beginning of the radiation of artiodactyls and decline of perissodactyls in the later Eocene of southern East Asia. Among the Pondaung perissodactyls, brontotheres and amynodonts are dominant in the collection size. The paleoenvironment of the Pondaung fauna is estimated as subtropical/tropical forest with large rivers and patches of open areas near seashore. Among the mammalian genera of the Pondaung fauna, only eight genera were shared with other Eocene faunas of East Asia. On the other hand, the Pondaung fauna shares Anthracotherium with the late Eocene to Oligocene faunas of Europe, and the Pondaung species are more primitive than the European ones. The Pondaung rodent is probably assigned to very primitive phiomyid or anomalurid, both of which had been recorded only in the late Eocene and latter age of Africa/West Asia. These suggest faunal migration from southern East Asia to Africa/West Eurasia during the later Eocene. If the Pondaung primates are really assigned to primitive anthropoids, they might migrate to Africa/West Asia with anthracotheres and/or rodents.},

Based on these specimens, we suggest that A. chrysophilus occupies most of the combined range, reaching its southern limit in northern South Africa, primarily in low elevations of the Limpopo River drainage. The remainder of South Africa is occupied by A. ineptus, which occurs at higher elevations in north-central South Africa but expands into lower elevation habitats in the southern portion of its range.

This revision was realized using craniometric data of nearly 1000 skulls grouped in 20 operational taxonomical units (OTU's) mainly occurring in the central and eastern part of the African continent. The observation that differences in age and sex composition of the OTU's are of no or little consequence for the branching of the obtained phenetic trees, allowed us to undertake the screening of the genus Dasymys of the central and eastern African region. This approach enabled us to evaluate already described taxa, to select a neotype for D. nudipes and to describe three new taxa. Subsequent genetic analysis (cytochrome b) allowed us to provide a genetical characterization of two of the new species and several other taxa. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that the genus Dasymys originated in the west African forest block before spreading in a first step to the forest of the central African region and then in a second step to the savannahs of southern, eastern and possibly also western Africa.},

	abstract = {A population and habitat viability analysis (PHVA) was carried out for the Malagasy giant jumping rat (Hypogeomys antimena), one of the key species of the highly threatened dry deciduous forests on the western coast of Madagascar. The occurrence of H. antimena is now confined to 200 km2 of fragmented but relatively undisturbed forest remnants, divided in northern and southern subpopulations. Since 1985 the habitat has declined by about 52\% (1985: 42,000 ha; 2000: 20,000 ha). The annual rate of habitat decline increased from 3.9\% between 1985 and 1995 to 4.4\% between 1995 and 2000. Within a study area (Kirindy Forest/CFPF) in the southern subpopulation, the Hypogeomys population collapsed during the decade 1990-2000, as well as over its remaining range. An ongoing population decline within the next 100 years is predicted even if further habitat decline can be stopped within the next 5 years and no additional mortality by roaming dogs is considered. Thereby, the outcomes of two different individual-based simulation approaches, one that was explicitly written to reflect Hypogeomys life history and VORTEX, one of the most common software packages used for this purpose, were compared. The results of the Hypogeomys model were more pessimistic, but were within the range of predictions of the VORTEX model which calculated larger standard deviations of the mean values. In both subpopulations, a slight increase in the mortality caused by roaming dogs resulted in a predicted decline to an average population size of maximal 170 individuals within 100 years with a high risk of extinction. However, the simulations indicated that the most important factor is reduction in habitat. If the actual annual rate of habitat lost continues, the extinction of the both subpopulations and therefore the entire species is predicted within 24 years.},

Little is known about the biology of these canids, especially the physiological mechanisms that contribute to their ability to live in such harsh environments. For individuals from Saudi Arabia, we tested the hypotheses that Ruppell's foxes have a reduced basal metabolic rate and total evaporative water loss (TEWL), parameters measured in the laboratory, and a reduced field metabolic rate (FMR) and water flux when free-living. Under basal conditions in the laboratory, males, which averaged 1,858 g in body mass, had an oxygen consumption of 914.9 mL O2/h, whereas females, which weighed on average 1,233 g, consumed 682.9 mL O2/h; rates of oxygen consumption translated to 441.4 kJ/d and 329.4 kJ/d, respectively. TEWL averaged 52.6 g H2O/d for males and 47.5 g H2O/d for females. We found no evidence that basal metabolism is reduced in Ruppell's foxes, but their TEWL was remarkably low: 50.9\% of allometric prediction for males and 64.5\% for females. In the wild during winter, males expended energy at a rate of 1,306.5 kJ/d, whereas females had an expenditure of 722.8 kJ/d. Analysis of covariance with FMR as the dependent variable, sex as a fixed factor, and body mass as a covariate showed no statistical difference in FMR between sexes. Water flux did not differ significantly between sexes and averaged 123 mL H2O/d, a value 30\% lower than the kit fox from the deserts of southwestern North America. FMR was positively related to nocturnal activity levels as FMR (kJ/d)=-2,900.1+55.5 (\% of time moving). The water content of prey items varied between 1.9 and 4.1 g H2O/g dry matter consumed. Based on these values and knowledge of their diet, we calculated that foxes captured about one rodent and a variety of anthropods per night of foraging.},

Mean values of heterozygosity per locus for each species ranged from 0.02 to 0.04. Mean values of Nei's genetic distance (D) between the taxa ranged from 0.06 (between A. flavicollis and A. alpicola) to 1.34 (between A. uralensis and A. agrarius). The highest values of D were found between A. agrarius and other Apodemus species (0.62-1.34). These values correspond to those generally observed between genera in small mammals. Our data show that A. agrarius and A. peninsulae are sister species, well-differentiated from other taxa. High genetic distance between A. m. mystacinus and A. m. epimelas leads us to consider them distinct species and sister taxa to other Western Palaearctic species of the subgenus Sylvaemus. The data also suggest a recent separation of members of the latter group from a common ancestor, and subsequent rapid radiation, making it difficult to infer phylogenetic relationships. Some taxonomic implications of the results are discussed further.},

	abstract = {The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) encodes a group of closely linked genes that play a central role in the vertebrate immune system. Most natural mammal populations studied so far possess high levels of diversity within the MHC. However, recent investigations in the MHC class II gene DQA of the critically endangered Malagasy giant jumping rat (Hypogeomys antimena) revealed very low variability compared to other mammalian species. The low genetic variability was confirmed in the present study through analyses of the MHC class II gene DRB exon 2. This codes for the antigen-binding site and is therefore considered as one of the most important parts of the MHC. The species' geographic distribution has been reduced recently to a fragmented area of suitable habitat within a geographic range of less than 20[x]40 km of dry deciduous forest at the west coast of Madagascar. H. antimena has some unusual life history characteristics for a rodent species, such as living in obligate monogamy, with pairs staying together until one mate dies, a low reproduction rate (one to two offspring/couple per year), high site and mate fidelity, short dispersal distances, almost no adult migration, and therefore a constant gene pool with very limited gene flow. Current hypotheses usually interpret low MHC polymorphism either as a consequence of reduced selection pressure, bottleneck effects or by constraints of the mating system. To differentiate between these hypotheses, the MHC variability of the DQA and DRB gene of two additional sympatric, but widely distributed rodent species, Macrotarsomys bastardi and Eliurus myoxinus, were studied by using universal primers and single-strand conformation polymorphism. The two species differ in their mating systems: M. bastardi also lives in pairs but E. myoxinus is a promiscuous species. Whereas the investigated MHC class II genes DQA and DRB had low levels of polymorphism in the pair-living species H. antimena and M. bastardi (DQA: 2 and 3 alleles, DRB: 5 and 6 alleles, respectively), higher levels of variation (DQA: 11 alleles, DRB: 9 alleles) were recorded in the promiscuous species, E. myoxinus. Gene diversity was also higher in E. myoxinus (DQA: 0.85, DRB: 0.86) than in the two pair-living species (DQA: 0.41-0.45, DRB: 0.55-0.63). The results suggest that low MHC variability might not only result from bottleneck effects due to recent declines in population size, but also from a monogamous mating system.},

	abstract = {We have sequenced 965 base pairs of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b (mtDNA cyt b) from 102 woodmice (Apodemus sylvaticus) samples collected from 40 European localities The aims of the study were to answer the following questions: i) Did the Mediterranean peninsulas play a role as a refuge for small mammals? ii) Is the genetic variability of a small mammal like A. svlvaticus higher in the Mediterranean regions as compared with northern Europe? iii) Is it possible to find patterns of postglacial colonisation of Europe other than those presently recognised? Sequence data were analysed using Distance and Maximum Parsimony phylogenetic reconstruction methods. A minimum spanning network was also calculated. Population genetic structure was determined by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). A (mismatch distribution) analysis was also performed to estimate the patterns of expansion. The results provide a clear picture of the impact of Quaternary glaciations on the genetic and geographic stricture of the woodmouse. Analyses indicate a higher genetic variability for the woodmouse in the Mediterranean peninsulas as compared to northern Europe and the role of these peninsulas as refuge regions for small mammals. A new pattern of postglacial colonisation is also proposed where the Iberian and southern France refuge populations colonised almost all the European regions. The Sicilian population appears to be highly differentiated and highly variable. This result emphasises the importance of this island as a (hot spot) for the intraspecific genetic diversity of the woodmouse. Finally, populations of this species in North Africa originated from south-western Europe and are probably the result of a recent anthropogenic introduction.},

One female showed the diploid number 2n = 24; in the two other individuals, the Rb(9.16) occurred in a heteromorphic condition, and, accordingly, the diploid number was 2n = 25. FISH showed the sites of telomeric sequences at telomeres of all the chromosomes, and in an interstitial position at the centromeres of all Robertsonian metacentrics, except one - the Rb(6.8), though the patterns of hybridization varied between chromosomes. Sex chromosome pairs, in the male and females, showed a similar C-banding pattern, but revealed clear differences after FISH. Traces of telomeric sequences were found dispersed in the whole-heterochromatic arm of the Rb(1.Xd). No visible bond between C-positive heterochromatin and telomeric sequences were detected in the other either bi- or uniarmed chromosomes, indicating that they may actually represent retained telomeres in the Robertsonian metacentrics.},

Field investigations revel that in the industrial zone of Sfax the average Cd content in the kidneys is significantly higher than that in the laboratory controls, animals captured in 40 km north-west of Sfax and animals from Hergla in center of Tunisia. The Cd contamination of the soil and vegetation which constitutes the main food source of Meriones s. shawi accounts partly for these rates. The body weight and serum level of calcium in the animals of these two stations are comparable to those of the laboratory controls. Laboratory investigations of animals of both sexes (n=24) reveal that when 1 g Cd/1 l H2O/1.5 kg granules is added to their diet, the average Cd content in the kidney increases significantly during the treatment: from 0.2 [mu]g/g dry weight in the controls to 103 [mu]g/dry weight after 30 days. However, this content stabilizes in the liver between 20 and 30 days, and in the duodenum between 5 and 30 days treatment. After 30 days of the experimentation, the body weight gain is of 19\% in comparison to the initial weight. It is 3 times less in the supplemented animals. Serum level of calcium decreases significantly after 10 days treatment. All these results show that the kidney of Meriones s. shawi can be considered as the preferential organ for Cd fixation, this metal alters body weight gain and the serum level of calcium. This mammal species would be considered as an indicator of Cd pollution.},

Compared to its congeners, O. unisulcatus has small litters of semi-precocial young which undergo rapid postnatal development, and contrary to expectations displays several K-selected reproductive characteristics. The reproductive biology and postnatal development of the bush Karoo appears to reflect a compromise between exploiting sporadically abundant resources and the occupation of stick lodges, which may provide a favourable microclimate to buffer the harsh external climate.},

Data were also gathered on the ecological characteristics of present cheetah habitats and the status of known and potential cheetah prey species in the area. Impacts of human activities on the cheetah, and on its preys and habitats were also investigated. The results show that the cheetah has disappeared from most of its former range in the northern part of the Egyptian Western Desert. Its entire population has been reduced to what appears to be few individuals confined to a highly inaccessible area in the northern and western parts of the Qattara Depression. These individuals appear to be essentially nomadic, roaming over a vast area of the desert in search of prey. Habitats presently occupied by the cheetah in Egypt include uninhabited oasis depressions within the Qattara Depression. Large groves of Acacia raddiana west and southwest of these habitats appear to be regularly visited by cheetahs. The survey also showed that gazelles, which constitute an important cheetah prey item, have been largely exterminated throughout the study area as a result of uncontrolled illegal hunting, with the exception of a small population which still survives in the western part of the Qattara Depression. Cape hare and several rodent species are numerous throughout present cheetah habitats, and may constitute the main cheetah prey in that area. We compare morphological characters of cheetahs of the Egyptian Western Desert to those of cheetahs from different parts of the world range of A. jubatus. Stringent conservation measures are needed to save this rare and possibly unique population of the cheetah.},

El-Amryia, El-Montaza, West and El-Gomrok Districts were, in order, the only infected districts. Neither gender nor season of collection has influence on the prevalence of infection. The present study proved the role of abattoirs in the prevalence of T. spiralis infection. However, high prevalence of T. spiralis infection was detected among higher age or higher body weight groups of rodents. Sensitivity of the digestion diagnostic technique is proved compared with compressorium diagnostic technique.

	abstract = {Aim: The modern African murine rodent Oenomys is a semiarboreal genus characteristic of the rain forest zone. The size and shape geographical differentiation is studied in order to discuss the possible evolutionary patterns and constraints leading to this distribution. Location: Two species of Oenomys have been previously recognized, corresponding to the West African forest block on the one hand and to the main forest block on the other hand. Both species have been sampled, and forty localities permit the study of the whole geographical range of Oenomys, from Guinea to Kenya. Methods: A Fourier analysis applied to the outlines of the first upper and lower molars allows a quantification of the size and shape variations across the geographical range of Oenomys. Results: This morphometrical analysis defines three morphological groups of Oenomys, corresponding to the West, Central, and East African forest zone. This result suggests the existence of an additional cryptic species. The Western group is characterized by broad asymmetrical molars and a small size. The Central African group has more elongated and larger molars while the Eastern African group displays extremely constricted molars and a small size. Main conclusion: The shape can be considered as charactheristic of each group and its variations appear to be mostly related to phylogeny while size exhibits variations within each group related to climatic gradients. This discrepancy could be related to different genetic determinants for both characters, the shape being strongly genetically constrained while size can vary according to a wide range of environmental factors.},

Segments of the Y chromosome and of a processed p53 pseudogene (PSIp53) were amplified from many of these mice and from others collected elsewhere in Eurasia and North Africa. The 251 mtDNA types, including 54 new ones reported here, now identified from commensal house mice (Mus musculus group) by sequencing this segment can be organized into four major lineages - domesticus, musculus, castaneus, and a new lineage found in Yemen. Evolutionary tree analysis suggested the domesticus mtDNAs as the sister group to the other three commensal mtDNA lineages and the Yemeni mtDNAs as the next oldest lineage. Using this tree and the phylogeographic approach, we derived a new model for the origin and radiation of commensal house mice whose main features are an origin in west-central Asia (within the present-day range of M. domesticus) and the sequential spreading of mice first to the southern Arabian Peninsula, thence eastward and northward into south-central Asia, and later from south-central Asia to north-central Asia (and thence into most of northern Eurasia) and to southeastern Asia. Y chromosomes with and without an 18-bp deletion in the Zfy-2 gene were detected among mice from Iran and Afghanistan, while only undeleted Ys were found in Turkey, Yemen, Pakistan, and Nepal. Polymorphism for the presence of a PSIp53 was observed in Georgia, Iran, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Sequencing of a 128-bp PSIp53 segment from 79 commensal mice revealed 12 variable sites and implicated gtoreq14 alleles. The allele that appeared to be phylogenetically ancestral was widespread, and the greatest diversity was observed in Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nepal.

Most recent taxonomic revisions list five to six species but the definition of some of these (Arvicanthis dembeensis, Arvicanthis nairobae, and Arvicanthis niloticus) is uncertain. The complete mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (1140 bp) was sequenced for 20 specimens from throughout the range of the genus to determine the intrageneric genetic structure, construct a molecular phylogeny, and evaluate classical taxonomies. Neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony analyses yielded identical phylogenetic trees that identify two major lineages: the first one (1) is composed of specimens usually referred to A. niloticus but representing several distinct species, and the other (2) is a complex including "true" A. niloticus from Egypt and northern West Africa as well as Arvicanthis abyssinicus, Arvicanthis dembeensis, and Arvicanthis somalicus. An analysis on a 357-bp fragment of the cytochrome b including published data on A. nairobae indicates that this taxon is part of clade (1). Calibration of the number of 3rd position transversion changes with the murid fossil record suggests that clades (1) and (2) diverged approximately 5 Myr ago. Arvicanthis niloticus as currently recognized is a paraphyletic association and this name should be restricted to the Egyptian and northern West African sample. We also suggest referring to A. dembeensis as A. niloticus, as our cytochrome b data do not support its recognition as a distinct species. Clade (1) is subdivided in three lineages, geographically corresponding to southern West, Central, and East Africa. The high genetic divergence detected between the Central African lineage and the other two lineages suggests that they probably represent separate species. Clade (2) experienced rapid cladogenetic events during the late Pliocene, with the A. somalicus lineage being the first to emerge, followed by the ancestor of A. abyssinicus and A.},

	abstract = {Analysis of 904 small carnivore scats collected over a two-year period in a seasonal forest in the southwestern Central African Republic yielded the remains of 732 shrews, rodents ({\textless} 1 kg), and bats comprising at least 34 species. Most scats belonged to the long-nosed mongoose, Herpestes naso, the numerically dominant carnivore in the study area. Shrews were the principal small mammal prey with respect to number of individuals and frequency of occurrence. The mean monthly frequency of occurrence of shrews was 21.7\% and of small rodents ({\textless}100 g) was 20.8\%. Both shrews and small rodents occurred significantly more often in scats collected during dry season months, and live-trapping of rodents over a 22-month period revealed similar peaks in availability. In contrast to many mammalian carnivores, shrews did not appear to be used as an alternative prey source: not only did consumption levels of both prey types fluctuate in synchrony, but the availability of rodents apparently had no effect upon the likelihood of including shrews in the diet. Preferential use of small mammals by long-nosed mongooses was tested for the 10 rodent species for which abundance indices were calculated. Mongooses preyed selectively on several rodent species (Praomys spp., Deomys ferrugineus, Stochomys longicaudatus, and Grammomys rutilans), while the most common rodent in the study area, Hylomyscus spp., was found in scats at lower frequencies than expected. In accordance with the habitat specificities of these 'preferred' rodent prey, it is suggested that mongooses and perhaps other small carnivores were foraging in micro-habitats characterized by higher-than-average vegetation understorey thickness where the simultaneous rate of encounter with arthropods, their main prey, and shrews was apt to be high.},

Staining with DNA dyes showed variation in intensity of fluorescence of the sperm chromatin, with an anterior spherical region staining far more intensely than the surrounding chromatin. Transmission electron microscopy of these spermatozoa indicated that this region was composed of cords and fibres. This chromatin region dispersed more readily than the surrounding chromatin when spermatozoa were incubated with the detergents, and it is suggested that, unlike the rest of the sperm chromatin, it may be a histone-rich region, with protamine(s) being either scarce or absent.},

	abstract = {Hypogeomys antimena, the largest endemic rodent of Madagascar, is exclusively found in a restricted area of less than 1000 km-2 in the deciduous dry forest near the western coast. The facts so far known about its biology, like pair bonds, 1-2 offspring, lack of sexual dimorphism, and the results of a nine-week trapping and radiotracking field study (Cook et al., 1991) suggest monogamy, a rare social system occurring in only 3\% of mammals. By using the same methods of trapping and radiotracking during different seasons, investigations in the proposed social system were carried out and provided a medium-term view of the social structure. The data on Hypogeomys antimena were then used to test hypotheses about the evolution of monogamy in rodents by comparing spacing behaviour and the size of home ranges of males and females before (dry season) and after (rainy season) the birth of offspring. Males and females from neighbouring burrows have similarly-sized but mutually exclusive home ranges. Home ranges of pairs trapped at the same burrows, however, always overlapped extensively. The morphological correlates (no sexual differences in the body measurements, small testes in relation to body size) are those of monogamous species. Pairs remain associated during both breeding and non-breeding periods and pair bonds seem to continue for more than one reproductive season. Offspring stay together with their parents for at least one more year, implying that sexual maturation is probably not reached before the age of two years. The results are consistent with the previous suggestion that Hypogeomys antimena lives in a monogamous social system. Home ranges are larger during the dry season before birth than during the rainy season after the birth of offspring. Pairs with offspring had smaller home ranges than those without. Males tended to stay closer to the offspring than females.},

Lophuromys nudicaudus on the other hand has a zoogeographical distribution covering probably the whole of the West-Central lowland rainforest between the north bank of the Zaire River and the Cross River (Gabon/RioMuni/R.C.A./ Cameroon/ Congo). Since one nudicaudus specimen (KMMA 6251) was collected in Basoko, far to the east of this region, it is probable that further collecting will prove it to be also present in the lowland rainforest on the right bank of the Zaire between the Ubangui and the Aruwimi rivers. Finally, there are indications (1) that specimens from the region between the Cross and Sanaga rivers differ sufficiently from typical nudicaudus to warrant taxonomical recognition under the subspecific name tullbergi and (2) that the Bioko-population, described under the subspecific name parvulus, is very close to its mainland counterpart and should therefore be put into synonymy with tullbergi.},

Elephants used heavily logged areas more than lightly logged and unlogged areas. Forest gaps were used more by elephants than closed-canopy areas and large gaps more than small ones. Gaps were larger in logged than unlogged forest. There were lower densities of young trees (saplings and poles) and a higher incidence of elephant damage to them in heavily logged forest than in lightly logged and unlogged sites. Elephant use of area and damage to young trees was inversely or unrelated to the density of young trees and directly related to the density of herbaceous tangle. Heavy togging resulted in large areas of herbaceous tangle, which attracted elephants who suppressed forest regeneration by damaging voting trees and perpetuating the herbaceous tangle. The tangle directly competed with regeneration of young trees while also attracting elephants and rodents (seed and seedling predators) and facilitating increased windthrow of trees. Selective browsing of young trees by elephants affected rates of regeneration, growth form and species composition. Rather than remove elephants, a more effective and humane approach to long-term management of logging is to reduce logging offtake and incidental damage caused by timber extraction.},

	abstract = {The species composition, and the number of species of mammals, in the Guinea-Congo rain forests varies with locality. The highest species richness (up to 130 species) is found in parts of the West Central and East Central rain forest regions, and the lowest richness occurs in the Western Region and on the periphery of the rain forest zone. Rodents and bats contribute the greatest number of species (about 25\% each), with lesser numbers of primates, duikers, and small insectivores; the relative numbers within each order is similar in all localities regardless of the composition and total numbers of species. The geographical distribution of each species is due to the alternating periods of forest fragmentation and expansion in the past, and the species-specific response to these environmental changes. There are about equal numbers of arboreal (30\%), terrestrial (35\%) and aerial (27\%) species, each species within these categories having very specific habitat requirements within the forest. Most rain forest mammals are either frugivores (36\%) or insectivores (37\%): monkeys are mainly arboreal frugivores and folivores, and most prosimians are arboreal insectivores; forest duikers are terrestrial frugivores, and terrestrial rodents are frugivores or omnivores. Leaves, in spite of their abundance, are rarely eaten because of their low nutritive value and the difficulties of digesting them and consequently folivores (9\%) are uncommon. Insects form the principal food for insect-bats and shrews. Mammals exhibit well-defined food partitioning in relation to food selection and body size, and therefore competition for food is probably minimal except during the dry season. Reproduction is more or less continuous in rodents and artiodactyls (with peaks of births at selected seasons); in contrast, monkeys and bats have fairly precise periods when births occur, which vary according to the species.},

Inglis (1961), studying the syntypes, concluded that the specimens belonged to the some species, which he transferred to Enterobius parallela (Linstow, 1908). After redescription of this species, it appears that these parasites share with the oxyurids in the genus Enterobius a number of morphological characteristics which are common to all the Oxyuridae genera parasites in Primates which consequently does not justify keeping the species in this genus. In addition this species differs from the known species in the genus Enterobius by the following characteristics: pairs 2 and 3 of genital papillae farther from the cloacal opening and surrounded by weak chitinized rings not fusing posterior to cloaca; egg asymmetry less marked; egg non-embryonated and without operculum; lateral alae differently shaped. Finally the parasites of Xerus present original characteristics: genital apparatus prodelphic whereas the general type is amphidelphic; cloacal opening covered by a hood-shaped flap whereas it is a longitudinal slit in all the related taxa; extremity of the spicular pouch protruding from the cloaca; ring-shaped gubernaculum present. Consequently it is proposed to transfer the species to a new genus: Xeroxyuris. The type and only species is Xeroxyuris parallela (Linstow, 1908), parasite of Xerus inauris in South-Africa.},

The G-banding pattern was also performed both on cultured fibroblasts and bone marrow preparations. The 2 n = 62 and the aFN = 74 characterize the South Benin cytotype which was found to be identical to that described for Southern Senegal specimens. A few chromosomal rearrangements (3 pericentric inversions) are enough to transform the Benin cytotype into the ANI-3 cytotype described in animals from Mali and Burkina Faso. A polymorphism of the X chromosome is described: three different forms (i.e. metacentric, submetacentric, and subtelocentric) were observed both in homomorphic and heteromorphic conditions.

To qualify as minilivestock, animals must have a potential benefit either nutritionally for food or economically for animal-feed or revenue, and currently not being utilized to their full potential. Rodents are eaten in Africa and Latin America. The guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) is considered a particularly efficient meat source. Giant African snails (Achatina spp) are highly prized as food in West and Central Africa and Asia, and are produced commercially. Annelids living in litter and manure convert vegetable refuse to animal protein which can be used as feed for pigs and poultry. There is a continuous demand for frogs' legs on the international market and also for many species of insect, alive or mounted.

The following results were indicated. (1) Genetic patterns: 11 of the 36 loci analysed (30.5 per cent) were monomorphic across the range, fifteen (41.7 per cent) were weakly polymorphic and the remaining 10 loci (27.8 per cent) were strongly polymorphic. (2) Heterozygosity: the average H was 0.051, range 0.00-0.098. In Israel, H increased with aridity and climatic unpredictability towards the northern Negev Desert, and was remarkably high in small steppic semi-isolates and desert isolates. (3) Species discrimination: some of the S. ehrenbergi species can be discriminated qualitatively. (4) Genetic distances (D): between species these values averaged 0.077, range 0.001-0.269, with the highest D between the ancestor Turkish and descendant Israeli and Egyptian species. The phylogenetic tree supports the Turkish origin of the Israeli Spalax ehrenbergi species, and the recent speciation of the Egyptian Spalax. (5) Genetic diversity is mostly (58 per cent) within populations. (6) Allozyme correlates: allozyme diversity was significantly correlated with the external physical (both climatic and edaphic) and biotic (parasite infection and plant cover) environment. (7) Spatial autocorrelation of allozyme frequencies suggests that migration is not influential. (8) Gametic phase disequilibria were significant in four out of five species tested, and were associated with climatic and edaphic factors. These results support the environmental selection hypothesis of genetic diversity including the niche-width variation hypothesis in space and time.

Positive thick blood smears were recorded in 17.6\% of the 740 rodents and 7.3\% of the 55 musk shrews tested. Variations of prevalence were analyzed in Arvicanthis niloticus and Mastomys huberti, which represented 62.7\% and 28.3\%, respectively, of the animals captured, and 65.7\% and 27.6\%, respectively, of the animals found infected. Borrelia crocidurae prevalence was significantly different between captures and fluctuated separately for each species. Age-specific prevalence of B. crocidurae showed distinct patterns, decreasing with age from 50\% in younger juveniles to 3\% in older adults for A. niloticus, while increasing with age from 8\% to 23\% for M. huberti. No relationship was observed with animal abundance or with the season of the year for either species. These findings suggest that the diversity of the population dynamics of host-vector-parasite associations in the Sahel region of Senegal may be a key factor for the relative stability of the borreliosis reservoir.},

Persistent viremia and viruria in rodents result from a slow or insufficient immune response when immunologically immature fetuses or neonates are infected. In humans, the disease is acute. There are five pathogens of humans, who are only accidental hosts. Four cause severe hemorrhagic fever with a mortality of about 15 percent among hospitalized patients in circumscribed areas (Lassa virus in West Africa, Junin virus in the Argentine pampas, Machupo virus in Bolivia, and Guanarito virus in Venezuela). The fifth, lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus, is much more widely distributed, but causes milder infections, often neurologic.

	abstract = {Endemic to West Africa and South America, mammalian arenaviruses can cross the species barrier from their natural rodent hosts to humans, resulting in illnesses ranging from mild flu-like syndromes to severe and fatal haemorrhagic zoonoses. The increased frequency of outbreaks and associated high fatality rates of the most prevalent arenavirus, Lassa, in West African countries, highlights the significant risk to public health and to the socio-economic development of affected countries. The devastating impact of these viruses is further exacerbated by the lack of approved vaccines and effective treatments. Differential immune responses to arenavirus infections that can lead to either clearance or rapid, widespread and uncontrolled viral dissemination are modulated by the arenavirus multifunctional proteins, NP and Z. These two proteins control the antiviral response to infection by targeting multiple cellular pathways; and thus, represent attractive targets for antiviral development to counteract infection. The interplay between the host immune responses and viral replication is a key determinant of virus pathogenicity and disease outcome. In this review, we examine the current understanding of host immune defenses against arenavirus infections and summarise the host protein interactions of NP and Z and the mechanisms that govern immune evasion strategies.},

	abstract = {Lassa fever is a unique viral hemorrhagic fever that is endemic in parts of West Africa, primarily Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Nigeria. The disease is caused by the Lassa virus, an Old World arenavirus that has as primary reservoir host the multimammate rodent Mastomys nataliensis, which lives in association with humans. Recent estimates suggest LF causes two million cases and 5000-10000 deaths annually, mainly in West Africa. Clinical diagnosis and laboratory confirmation have always been major challenges for effective management and control of the disease in afflicted areas of West Africa. Recent advancements in molecular biology, recombinant DNA technology, and genomics sequencing has facilitated major advancement in development of better diagnostic and surveillance tools for Lassa fever virus. These include, the multiplex, magnetic bead-based immunodiagnostics for both Lassa virus antigens and antibodies; molecular probe-based quantitative real-time PCR for genomic signatures; rapid diagnostics tests that detects the most prevalent West African lineages; and the successful utilization of next-generation sequencing technology to diagnose and characterize Lassa virus in West Africa. These advances will continue to improve disease treatment, control, and prevention. In this review we will discuss progression of Lassa virus diagnostics from the past and into the future.

	abstract = {Lassa virus (LASV) is a rodent-borne arenavirus endemic to several West African countries that causes Lassa fever (LF). LF is typically mild but it can cause severe disease characterized by hemorrhagic fever and multi-organ failure. A current outbreak of LASV in Nigeria has seen greater than 300 cases with a case fatality rate of 22\%. Currently, there are limited treatment options and no vaccine candidates are approved to prevent LASV infection. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations has identified LASV as an emerging pathogen of high consequence and this has resulted in a push for several preclinical vaccine candidates to be advanced toward clinical trials. Here, we discuss several important aspects of LASV infection including immunobiology, immune evasion, and correlates of protection against LF, which have been identified through animal models and human infections. In addition, we discuss several vaccine candidates that have shown efficacy in animal models that could be advanced toward clinical trials. The increased fatality rate seen in the recent LASV outbreak in Nigeria highlights the importance of developing effective treatment and prevention strategies against LF. The spike in LASV cases seen in West Africa has the potential for increased mortality and human-to-human transmission, making the development and testing of effective vaccines for LASV critical.},

	abstract = {Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) is a zoonotic disease caused by several Borrelia species transmitted to humans by Ornithodoros tick vectors. In West Africa, Borrelia crocidurae is a common cause of disease in many rural populations. Small mammals act as reservoirs of infection. We report here the results of surveys that investigated the occurrence of B. crocidurae infection in rodents and insectivores from eight countries of West and Central Africa. Animals were identified at the species level and tested for Borrelia either by examination of thick blood film, intra-peritoneal inoculation of blood or brain tissues into laboratory mice, or by molecular techniques. A total of 4358 small mammals belonging to 38 species and 7 families were collected, including 3225 specimens collected in areas where the occurrence of Ornithodoros sonrai tick in rodent burrows was documented, and 1133 in areas where this tick was absent. In areas with O. sonrai, Borrelia infection was demonstrated in 287 of 3109 (9.2\%) small mammals tested, and none was documented in 1004 animals tested from other areas. There was no relationship between the occurrence of Rhipicephalus, Hyaloma and Argas ticks in burrows and the distribution of Borrelia infection in small mammals. The 287 specimens infected by Borrelia belonged to 15 rodent and shrew species, including three Saharo-Sahelian species - Gerbillus gerbillus, Gerbillus occiduus and Gerbillus tarabuli - identified as reservoirs for TBRF with a distribution restricted to this area. In Sudan and Sudano-Sahelian areas, Arvicanthis niloticus, Mastomys erythroleucus and Mastomys huberti were the main reservoir of infection. Although most small mammals species collected had a large distribution in West and Central Africa, the fact that only animals collected in areas with O. sonrai were found infected suggest that this tick is the only vector of TBRF in rodents and insectivores in this part of Africa.

In this paper, we explored the effects of certainty of diagnosis, oversampling in well-studied region, and error balance on results of mapping exercises. Each of the three factors assessed in this study had clear and consistent influences on model results, overestimating risk in southern, humid zones in West Africa, and underestimating risk in drier and more northern areas. The final, adjusted risk map indicates broad risk areas across much of West Africa. Although risk maps are increasingly easy to develop from disease occurrence data and raster data sets summarizing aspects of environments and landscapes, this process is highly sensitive to issues of data quality, sampling design, and design of analysis, with macrogeographic implications of each of these issues and the potential for misrepresenting real patterns of risk.},

Here, we evaluated BLI as a novel approach for tracking MPX virus infection in black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). Prairie dogs were affected during a multistate outbreak of MPX in the US in 2003 and have since been used as an animal model of this disease. Our BLI results were compared with PCR and virus isolation from tissues collected postmortem. Virus was easily detected and quantified in skin and superficial tissues by BLI before and during clinical phases, as well as in subclinical secondary cases, but was not reliably detected in deep tissues such as the lung. Although there are limitations to viral detection in larger wild rodent species, BLI can enhance the use of prairie dogs as an animal model of MPX and can be used for the study of infection, disease progression, and transmission in potential wild rodent reservoirs.},

After having collected molecular evidence of an indigenous African hantavirus in 2006, an intensive investigation for new hantaviruses has been started in small mammals. Various novel hantaviruses have been molecularly identified not only in rodents but also in shrews and bats. In addition, the first African hantavirus, Sangassou virus, has been isolated and functionally characterized in cell culture. Less is known about the ability of these hantaviruses to infect humans and to cause diseases. To date, no hantavirus genetic material could be amplified from patients' specimens collected in Africa. Serological studies in West Africa, based on a battery of screening and confirmatory assays, led to the detection of hantavirus antibodies in the human population and in patients with putative hantavirus disease. In addition to this overview, we present original data from seroepidemiological and field studies conducted in the Southern part of Africa. A human seroprevalence rate of 1.0\% (n=1442) was detected in the South African Cape Region whereas no molecular evidence for the presence of hantavirus was found in 2500 small animals trapped in South Africa and Namibia.

A live attenuated reassortant of MOPV and LASV, designated ML29, protects rodents and primates from LASV challenge and appears to be more attenuated than MOPV. To gain better insight into LASV-induced pathology and mechanism of attenuation we performed gene expression profiling in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) exposed to LASV and the vaccine candidate ML29. PBMC from healthy human subjects were exposed to either LASV or ML29. Although most PBMC are non-permissive for virus replication, they remain susceptible to signal transduction by virus particles. Total RNA was extracted and global gene expression was evaluated during the first 24 hours using high-density microarrays. Results were validated using RT-PCR, flow cytometry and ELISA. LASV and ML29 elicited differential expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG), as well as genes involved in apoptosis, NF-kB signaling and the coagulation pathways. These genes could eventually serve as biomarkers to predict disease outcomes. The remarkable differential expression of thrombomodulin, a key regulator of inflammation and coagulation, suggests its involvement with vascular abnormalities and mortality in Lassa fever disease.},

	abstract = {A number of viruses in the family Arenaviridae cause severe illness in humans. Lassa virus in West Africa and a number of agents in South America produce hemorrhagic fever in persons exposed to aerosolized excretions of the pathogens' rodent hosts. Because arenaviruses are not transmitted by arthropods, and person-to-person spread is rare, human infections occur singly and sporadically, and are usually not diagnosed until the patient is severely ill. Because the arenaviruses are naturally transmitted by the airborne route, they also pose a potential threat as aerosolized bioterror weapons. The broad-spectrum antiviral drug ribavirin was shown to reduce mortality from Lassa fever, and has been tested against Argentine hemorrhagic fever, but it is not an approved treatment for either disease. Human immune convalescent plasma was proven to be effective for Argentine hemorrhagic fever in a controlled trial. New treatments are needed to block viral replication without causing toxicity and to prevent the increased vascular permeability that is responsible for hypotension and shock.

	abstract = {Lassa fever remains a serious challenge to public health in West Africa threatening both local residents in rural areas and those who serve them, particularly medical care providers. Given the ecology of the rodent host and conditions in the endemic area, a vaccine is mandatory for control. The challenge is to overcome the scientific, political and economic obstacles to producing a human use vaccine candidate. There are some scientific issues to resolve. It is known that the G-protein confers protection but we do not know its duration. If the N-protein is also included there may be a better duration of protection but it is unclear whether the N-protein as a vaccine may possibly enhance the infection. The original vaccinia vector must be replaced by new vectors, chimeras or by delivering DNA in some format. A live vaccine is attractive because it can confer protection in a single shot. A killed vaccine is more stable, particularly for distribution in the tropics but usually requires repeated shots. For practical reasons a live vaccine format should probably be pursued, which could then be combined with a yellow fever vaccine, using the same cold chains, since this disease occupies the same endemic areas in West Africa. Lassa vaccine initiatives have suffered from a lack of funding in the past but bioterrorism has brought new resources to Lassa virus science. Adequate funding and applications of new vaccine technologies give hope that we may soon see a vaccine in clinical trials. However, the difficulty of conducting trials in endemic areas and lack of political stability remain serious problems. [References: 61]},

We carried out a retrospective study from 1996 to 1998 and a prospective study in 1998. All cases recorded in this period in visited health centres were included. A total of 1845 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis was identified, 50.3\% of whom concerned women. The age of patients varied between 1 and 79 years for 356 patients, with a mean age of 26.7 years. Cases increased between 1996 and 1998 (1996 = 61 cases, 1997 = 552 cases, 1998 = 1218 cases). The months of highest incidence were August (13\%), September (15\%) and October (17\%). Peripheral districts (28, 30, 29, 16, 15) in south-eastern areas of the town were the worst touched with 87\% of cases. On average, patients seek care after 2 months of progression of the disease. The ulcero-crusted form (68.2\%) was the most frequent clinical form observed for 327 patients, but almost half of the cases had more than one site of infection, (43.5\%). Over half of the patients presented fewer than 10 lesions with an average of 6. The most common locations were on uncovered parts of the body, notably the superior (53\%) and inferior limbs (49\%). The parasite could be tested for by smear on 52 patients only in 1998 and 53.8\% of cases tested were positive. Leishmania major, which is very prevalent in West Africa was identified in one patient. The vectors and main reservoirs of the parasite were not studied. Case management was generally incomplete; the most commonly prescribed drugs were antibiotics (70\% of patients), but self-medication was frequent. Our recommendations after this preliminary study are: undertake multidisciplinary studies on cutaneous leishmaniasis in Ouagadougou in order to understand the local aetiology (vectors responsible for transmission, rodent and domestic animals involved in the epidemiological chain, parasite species); identify all other areas in the country where the disease is highly prevalent provide health care staff with a decisional algorithm and protocol therapy carry out and active control programme for cutaneous leishmaniasis in Burkina Faso.},

	abstract = {We have investigated whether naturally induced immunity to Plasmodium falciparum thrombospondin related adhesive protein contributes to protection against malaria in humans. We have carried out a case control study in children living in an endemic region of West Africa to reveal associations between PfTRAP seroprevalence and the risk of cerebral malaria. Sera collected from the case and control groups were analysed by ELISA to compare their serum reactivity against PfTRAP, the circumsporozoite protein and the merozoite surface protein 1. Children with uncomplicated malaria had a significantly higher PfTRAP seroprevalence when compared to children with cerebral malaria. The risk of developing cerebral malaria appeared to depend on the reciprocal relationship between sporozoite inoculation rates and humoral immunity against PfTRAP. Our results suggest that naturally induced humoral immunity against PfTRAP contributes to the development of protection against severe malaria. Experimentally induced immunity against TRAP in different rodent models has consistently proven to elicit a high degree of protection against malaria. This together with the functional properties of TRAP and data describing CD4 and CD8 epitopes for PfTRAP indicate that this molecule could increase the protective efficiency of available sporozoite malaria vaccines.

	abstract = {Lassa virus causes hemorrhagic fever in West Africa. Previously, we demonstrated by PCR screening that only the multimammate mouse, Mastomys natalensis, hosts Lassa virus in Guinea. In the present study, we used the same specimen collection from 17 villages in Coastal, Upper, and Forest Guinea to investigate the Lassa virus serology in the rodent population. The aim was to determine the dynamics of antibody development in M. natalensis and to detect potential spillover infections in other rodent species. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody screening was performed using the indirect immunofluorescence assay with the Guinean Lassa virus strain Bantou 289 as antigen. The overall seroprevalence was 8\% (129/1551) with the following rodents testing positive: 109 M. natalensis, seven Mastomys erythroleucus, four Lemniscomys striatus, four Praomys daltoni, three Mus minutoides, and two Praomys rostratus. Nearly all of them (122/129) originated from Bantou, Tanganya, and Gbetaya, where Lassa virus is highly endemic in M. natalensis. The antibody seroprevalence in M. natalensis from this high-endemic area (27\%; 108/396) depended on the village, habitat, host age, and host abundance. A main positive factor was age; the maximum seroprevalence reached 50\% in older animals. Our data fit with a model implicating that most M. natalensis rodents become horizontally infected, clear the virus within a period significantly shorter than their life span, and develop antibodies. In addition, the detection of antibodies in other species trapped in the habitats of M. natalensis suggests spillover infections.},

	abstract = {Ticks and tick-borne pathogens constitute a great threat to livestock production and are a potential health hazard to humans. Grasscutters (Thryonomys swinderianus) are widely hunted for meat in Ghana and many other West and Central African countries. However, tick-borne zoonotic risks posed by wild grasscutters have not been assessed. The objective of this study was to investigate bacterial and protozoan pathogens in ticks infecting wild grasscutters. A total of 81 ticks were collected from three hunted grasscutters purchased from Kantamanto, the central bushmeat market in Accra. Ticks were identified as Ixodes aulacodi and Rhipicephalus sp. based on morphological keys, which were further confirmed by sequencing mitochondrial 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and cytochrome oxidase I (COI) genes of specimens. Protozoan infections were tested by PCR amplifying 18S rDNA of Babesia/Theileria/Hepatozoon, while bacterial infections were evaluated by PCRs or real-time PCRs targeting Anaplasmataceae, Borrelia, spotted fever group rickettsiae, chlamydiae and Candidatus Midichloria mitochondrii. The results of PCR screening showed that 35.5\% (27 out of 76) of I. aulacodi were positive for parasite infections. Sequencing analysis of the amplified products gave one identical sequence showing similarity with Babesia spp. reported from Africa. The Ca. M. mitochondrii endosymbiont was present in 85.5\% (65 out of 76) of I. aulacodi but not in the five Rhipicephalus ticks. Two Anaplasmataceae bacteria genetically related to Ehrlichia muris and Anaplasma phagocytophilum were also detected in two I. aulacodi. None of the ticks were positive for Borrelia spp., spotted fever group rickettsiae and chlamydiae. Since I. aulacodi on wild grasscutters are potential carriers of tick-borne pathogens, some of which could be of zoonotic potential, rigorous tick control and pathogen analyses should be instituted especially when wild caught grasscutters are being used as foundation stock for breeding.},

The study was part of a broader project that was investigating Salmonella vectors in the poultry farms around the province. The study trapped 154 rodents from selected farms and used the Cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) and the Cytochrome b (Cyt-b) barcoding genes for species identification. Two rodent pest species, namely, Rattus rattus (the black rat) and Rattus tanezumi (the Asian Rat/Asian House Rat) were identified. A total of 99 (64.3\%) were identified as Rattus rattus and 55 (35.7\%) were Rattus tanezumi. Between the two target genes, Cyt-b gene was only able to identify 40 (25.97\%) of the total samples while COI was more efficient and amplified all the samples and thus was a better target gene for this kind of identification. The two rat species identified are known vectors of serious diseases; thus their presence should be regarded as an indication of high risk for diseases. Despite having been detected in the country before, finding R. tanezumi as the second largest rat species in the area was unexpected since this species is known to be indigenous to Asia.},

Recently, we described hedgehog Leishmania (L.) major and L. infantum infection in an L. infantum endemic area in the North-West. In order to assess if the observation could extend to other endemic areas and to highlight the potential role of hedgehogs as reservoir host, we aimed here at investigating their Leishmania infection in different foci in Tunisia located along a North-South transect, during and outside different transmission seasons. Based on morphological criteria, 2 hedgehogs' species, Atelerix algirus and Paraechinus aethiopicus were identified. Cytologic analysis showed presence of amastigotes in 9/22 samples corresponding to 4 Atelerix algirus specimens. Also, by combining 3 PCR tests targeting repeated DNA fragments using 13A/13B, Lei70R/Lei70L and nested T2/B4-L1/L4 specific primers, all hedgehogs (N = 12) showed a Leishmania infection. The infection rates were very high on spleen (91.66\%), kidney (91.66\%), blood (90.90\%), liver (83.33\%) and eye swabs (100\%). Parasites were also detected in peritoneum. Three hedgehogs were found infected with L. infantum and the only Paraechinus aethiopicus specimen with L. major. A mixed L. major and L. infantum infection was identified in 8 animals, while the last one also had an L. tropica infection. Interestingly, 2 animals had skin lesions infected with L. major while all others appeared asymptomatic. There was a correlation between infected status and epidemiological profiles of the localities. Sequences and phylogeny indicated micro-heterogeneity and lack of correlation with sampling, season, or localities. We confirmed natural infection of Atelerix algirus and originally of Paraechinus aethiopicus in Tunisia. High rate of asymptomatic infection, parasitemia, proximity to transmission cycles, epidemiological patterns of infection together with hedgehogs' abundance, lifespan and lifestyle corroborate the hypothesis they constitute reservoir hosts.},

AchPV1 and AchPV2 are classified in the family Paramyxoviridae and cluster with other bat derived zoonotic rubulaviruses (i.e. Sosuga, Menangle and Tioman viruses). To assess the susceptibility of AchPV1 and AchPV2 in animals, infection studies were conducted in ferrets, guinea pigs and mice. Seroconversion, immunohistological evidence of infection, and viral shedding were identified in ferrets and guinea pigs, but not in mice. Infection was associated with respiratory disease in ferrets. Viral genome was detected in a range of tissues from ferrets and guinea pigs, however virus isolation was only achieved from ferret tissues. The results from this study indicate Achimota viruses (AchPVs) are able to cross the species barrier. Consequently, vigilance for infection with and disease caused by these viruses in people and domesticated animals is warranted in sub-Saharan Africa and the Arabian Peninsula where the reservoir hosts are present.},

However, support for the ICHH has been variable and an alternative hypothesis suggests that testosterone may be acting indirectly via cortisol to suppress immunity (the stress-linked ICHH). A third hypothesis is that increased energetic investment in immunity results in the suppression of testosterone. We tested these hypotheses in male Cape ground squirrels (Xerus inauris) through two separate manipulations: first, by triggering a strong immune response using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection and, secondly, by increasing circulating testosterone using silastic testosterone implants. Responding to an immune challenge significantly reduced testosterone, supporting the immune suppression hypothesis, while increasing circulating testosterone had no effect on immunocompetence, body mass, ectoparasite abundances or cortisol levels, failing to support either the ICHH or stress-linked ICHH. Our results add to the increasing body of literature that challenges the ICHH, and we conclude that the trade-off between testosterone and immunity is mediated through immune activation and not through testosterone in male Cape ground squirrels. Being able to test the ICHH, stress-linked ICHH and immune suppression hypotheses in a free-ranging mammal gives us a unique opportunity to examine the mechanisms mediating this trade-off.},

	abstract = {Leishmaniasis, a public health problem in Tunisia, are diseases caused by different Leishmania species. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is present from the North to the South under different forms, due to Leishmania (L.) major, L. infantum or L. tropica. Whereas, Psammomys (P.) obesus is the confirmed reservoir host of L. major, those of L. tropica and dermotropic L. infantum wait to be identified. Importantly, P. vexillaris species have been recently highlighted; however, no studies have been carried out to explore its potential role in leishmaniasis epidemiology. Seventy two rodents were collected from Central and South-West of Tunisia between 2007 and 2010. Using several methods, 43 animals were identified as P. obesus and 29 as P. vexillaris. Leishmania kinetoplast DNA was detected in liver samples by real-time PCR in 18 P. obesus and in 8 P. vexillaris. Then, the direct sequencing of the amplified internal transcribed spacer 1, allowed the identification of L. infantum DNA in five P. obesus and in three P. vexillaris, as well as L. tropica DNA in three other P. vexillaris. Whereas, PCR fluorescent fragment length analysis of the 7 spliced leaders, allowed identifying L. major among infected P. obesus and P. vexillaris, and interestingly co-infection (L. major/L. infantum) among two P. obesus. We report here for the first time, the infection of P. obesus, from Central Tunisia, by L. infantum. Suggesting that P. obesus the known reservoir host of L. major, may also serve as reservoir host for L. infantum and thus play a role in the spread of sporadic cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis in this region. Of equal importance, this work establish for the first time, the natural infection of P. vexillaris by different Leishmania species, suggesting its potential epidemiological role as reservoir host.},

	abstract = {Biological invasions are major anthropogenic changes associated with threats to biodiversity and health. However, what determines the successful establishment and spread of introduced populations remains unclear. Here, we explore several hypotheses linking invasion success and immune phenotype traits, including those based on the evolution of increased competitive ability concept. We compared gene expression profiles between anciently and recently established populations of two major invading species, the house mouse Mus musculus domesticus and the black rat Rattus rattus, in Senegal (West Africa). Transcriptome analyses identified differential expression between anciently and recently established populations for 364 mouse genes and 83 rat genes. All immune-related genes displaying differential expression along the mouse invasion route were overexpressed at three of the four recently invaded sites studied. Complement activation pathway genes were overrepresented among these genes. By contrast, no particular immunological process was found to be overrepresented among the differentially expressed genes of black rat. Changes in transcriptome profiles were thus observed along invasion routes, but with different specific patterns between the two invasive species. These changes may be driven by increases in infection risks at sites recently invaded by the house mouse, and by stochastic events associated with colonization history for the black rat. These results constitute a first step toward the identification of immune eco-evolutionary processes potentially involved in the invasion success of these two rodent species.},

The small mammal fauna of Sierra Leone is poorly documented, although bats and rodents account for the majority of mammalian diversity. Based on morphological, genetic and echolocation data, we recorded 30 bat (Chiroptera), three shrew (Soricomorpha) and eleven rodent (Rodentia) species at the Seli River in the north of the country in 2014 and 2016, during a baseline study for the Bumbuna Phase II hydroelectric project. In 2016, 15 bat species were additionally documented at the western fringe of the Loma Mountains, a recently established national park and biodiversity offset for the Bumbuna Phase I dam. Three bat species were recorded for the first time in Sierra Leone, raising the total number for the country to 61. Further, two bat species are threatened and endemic to the Upper Guinean Forest and several taxa of small mammals are poorly known or represent undescribed species. Overall, the habitats of the project area supported a species-rich small mammal fauna including species of global conservation concern. Suitable mitigation measures and/or offsets are necessary to maintain biodiversity and ecosystems in a region that is under high human pressure.},

	abstract = {Purpose: In furthering the understanding of the process of spermatogenesis in the greater cane rat, this study describes the ultrastructural spermiogenic transformation and acrosomal formation in the testes of this hystricomorphic rodent that is currently undergoing domestication in parts of West Africa., Materials and Methods: Testicular samples were obtained from ten sexually mature cane rats that were perfused-fixed using Karnovsky's fixative (phosphate buffered 2\% paraformaldehyde - 2.5\% glutaraldehyde fixative at pH 7.4). The samples were processed for ultrastructural analysis and examined under the transmission electron microscope., Results: The testes of the cane rat showed uniqueness in its cellular associations and the ultrastructure of the spermatogenic cells especially in the formation of the acrosome. The spermatid differentiation and acrosomal formation occurred in 12 steps with the first three steps being the Golgi phase and the next three steps making up the cap phase. While the three steps that follow constitute the acrosomal phase, the last 3 steps make up the maturation phase. At the cap and acrosomal phases, the entire acrosomal system comprising the vesicle and granule covers the head of the spermatids with no clear indentation of the nuclear surface by the formed acrosome. Furthermore, elongated spermatids at the maturation phase contained abundance of nuclear vacuoles., Conclusion: This work has not only provided information that will further the understanding of spermatogenesis but also aid the understanding of acrosomal reaction in the reproduction of the greater cane rat.},

LASV is the causative agent of Lassa fever, a deadly hemorrhagic fever endemic in West Africa, whereas MOPV is non-pathogenic in humans. The Z matrix protein of arenaviruses is essential to virus assembly and budding by recruiting host factors, a mechanism that remains partially defined. To better characterize the interactions involved, a yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted using the Z proteins from LASV and MOPV as a bait. The cellular proteins ITCH and WWP1, two members of the Nedd4 family of HECT E3 ubiquitin ligases, were found to bind the Z proteins of LASV, MOPV and other arenaviruses. The PPxY late-domain motif of the Z proteins is required for the interaction with ITCH, although the E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity of ITCH is not involved in Z ubiquitination. The silencing of ITCH was shown to affect the replication of the old-world mammarenaviruses LASV, MOPV, Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and to a lesser extent Lujo virus (LUJV). More precisely, ITCH was involved in the egress of virus-like particles and the release of infectious progeny viruses. Thus, ITCH constitutes a novel interactor of LASV and MOPV Z proteins that is involved in virus assembly and release.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.05.010},
	abstract = {Lassa fever is an acute viral illness caused by Lassa virus (LASV), a rodent-borne pathogen. LASV is endemic to much of Sub-Saharan West Africa, where seasonal outbreaks cause significant morbidity and mortality. Increased global awareness of LASV has led to development of improved diagnostic tests, treatments and vaccines. As vaccine candidates are trialled, it is essential to assess the potential outcomes of introducing a LASV vaccination program in endemic regions. This study investigates the potential outcomes of routine and pulse vaccination strategies using a deterministic mathematical model that captures seasonal LASV transmission between rodents and humans. For plausible parameter values, we find that immunization of 40\% of infants at 70\% vaccine effectiveness achieves a population-level reduction in infectious case numbers of 30\%, while coverage of 60\% at 90\% vaccine effectiveness achieves a 56\% reduction. Similar reductions can be achieved more rapidly via population-wide pulse vaccination at 11\% coverage (30\% reduction at 70\% effectiveness) or 23\% coverage (56\% reduction at 90\% effectiveness) repeated every 10years. Similar pulse vaccine doses delivered at reduced frequency, but increased coverage achieves a greater reduction in infectious cases. Findings around infant vaccination are sensitive to our assumption that immunity is life-long, while pulse-vaccination has only slightly reduced effect if immunity lasts 10-30years. An effective LASV vaccination program would incorporate pulse vaccination in addition to routine childhood immunization to limit disease. Estimates of feasible vaccine coverage and effectiveness are needed to fully quantify the likely benefits of a vaccination program in LASV endemic regions. Crown Copyright © 2019.

Intensified research and development of Lassa fever medical countermeasures have yielded some vaccine candidates with preclinical scientific plausibility using predominantly novel technology. The more advanced candidates are based on recombinant measles, Vesicular Stomatitis Virus or Mopiea and Lassa virus reassortants expressing Lassa virus antigens, and the deoxyribonucleic acid platform. However, the Lassa fever portfolio still lags behind other neglected tropical diseases', and further investments are needed for continued development and additional research, such as the safety and efficacy of these vaccine candidates in special populations.

We surveyed wild small mammal populations in the areas of Richard Toll and Lake Guiers, Senegal, with the objective to evaluate their potential role as intermediate hosts of larval taeniid stages (i.e. metacestodes). Based on genetic sequences of a segment of the mitochondrial DNA gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI), we identified Hydatigera parva metacestodes in 19 out of 172 (11.0\%) Hubert's multimammate mice (Mastomys huberti) and one out of six (16.7\%) gerbils (Taterillus sp.) and Hydatigera taeniaeformis sensu stricto metacestodes in one out of 215 (0.5\%) Nile rats (Arvicanthis niloticus). This study reports epidemiological and molecular information on H. parva and H. taeniaeformis in West African rodents, further supporting the phylogeographic hypothesis on the African origin of H. parva. Our findings may indicate significant trophic interactions contributing to the local transmission of Hydatigera spp. and other parasites with similar life-cycle mechanisms. We therefore propose that further field investigations of rodent population dynamics and rodent-borne infectious organisms are necessary to improve our understanding of host-parasite associations driving the transmission risks of rodent parasites in West Africa.},

	abstract = {Commensal rodent species are key reservoirs for Toxoplasma gondii in the domestic environment. In rodents, different T. gondii strains show variable patterns of virulence according to host species. Toxoplasma gondii strains causing non-lethal chronic infections in local hosts will be more likely to persist in a given environment, but few studies have addressed the possible role of these interactions in shaping the T. gondii population structure. In addition, the absence of validated techniques for upstream detection of T. gondii chronic infection in wild rodents hinders exploration of this issue under natural conditions. In this study, we took advantage of an extensive survey of commensal small mammals in three coastal localities of Senegal, with a species assemblage constituted of both native African species and invasive species. We tested 828 individuals for T. gondii chronic infection using the modified agglutination test for antibody detection in serum samples and a quantitative PCR assay for detection of T. gondii DNA in brain samples. The infecting T. gondii strains were genotyped whenever possible by the analysis of 15 microsatellite markers. We found (i) a very poor concordance between molecular detection and serology in the invasive house mouse, (ii) significantly different levels of prevalence by species and (iii) the autochthonous T. gondii Africa 1 lineage strains, which are lethal for laboratory mice, only in the native African species of commensal small mammals. Overall, this study highlights the need to reconsider the use of MAT serology in natural populations of house mice and provides the first known data about T. gondii genetic diversity in invasive and native species of small mammals from Africa. In light of these results, we discuss the role of invasive and native species, with their variable adaptations to different T. gondii strains, in shaping the spatial structure of T. gondii genetic diversity in Africa.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis and food-borne trematodiases are not only of major public health concern, but can also have profound implications for livestock production and wildlife conservation. The zoonotic, multi-host nature of many digenean trematodes is a significant challenge for disease control programmes in endemic areas. However, our understanding of the epidemiological role that animal reservoirs, particularly wild hosts, may play in the transmission of zoonotic trematodiases suffers a dearth of information, with few, if any, standardised, reliable diagnostic tests available. We combined qualitative and quantitative data derived from post-mortem examinations, coprological analyses using the Mini-FLOTAC technique, and molecular tools to assess parasite community composition and the validity of non-invasive methods to detect trematode infections in 89 wild Hubert's multimammate mice (Mastomys huberti) from northern Senegal., RESULTS: Parasites isolated at post-mortem examination were identified as Plagiorchis sp., Anchitrema sp., Echinostoma caproni, Schistosoma mansoni, and a hybrid between Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma bovis. The reports of E. caproni and Anchitrema sp. represent the first molecularly confirmed identifications for these trematodes in definitive hosts of sub-Saharan Africa. Comparison of prevalence estimates derived from parasitological analysis at post-mortem examination and Mini-FLOTAC analysis showed non-significant differences indicating comparable results between the two techniques (P = 1.00 for S. mansoni; P = 0.85 for E. caproni; P = 0.83 for Plagiorchis sp.). A Bayesian model, applied to estimate the sensitivities of the two tests for the diagnosis of Schistosoma infections, indicated similar median posterior probabilities of 83.1\% for Mini-FLOTAC technique and 82.9\% for post-mortem examination (95\% Bayesian credible intervals of 64.0-94.6\% and 63.7-94.7\%, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the Mini-FLOTAC could be applied as an alternative diagnostic technique for the detection of the zoonotic S. mansoni and other trematodes in rodent reservoirs. The implementation of non-invasive diagnostics in wildlife would offer numerous advantages over lethal sampling methodologies, with potential impact on control strategies of zoonotic helminthiases in endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa and on fostering a framework of animal use reduction in scientific practice.},

	abstract = {Lassa fever is a unique viral hemorrhagic fever that is endemic in parts of West Africa, primarily Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Nigeria. The disease is caused by the Lassa virus, an Old World arenavirus that has as primary reservoir host the multimammate rodent Mastomys nataliensis, which lives in association with humans. Recent estimates suggest LF causes two million cases and 5000-10000 deaths annually, mainly in West Africa. Clinical diagnosis and laboratory confirmation have always been major challenges for effective management and control of the disease in afflicted areas of West Africa. Recent advancements in molecular biology, recombinant DNA technology, and genomics sequencing has facilitated major advancement in development of better diagnostic and surveillance tools for Lassa fever virus. These include, the multiplex, magnetic bead-based immunodiagnostics for both Lassa virus antigens and antibodies; molecular probe-based quantitative real-time PCR for genomic signatures; rapid diagnostics tests that detects the most prevalent West African lineages; and the successful utilization of next-generation sequencing technology to diagnose and characterize Lassa virus in West Africa. These advances will continue to improve disease treatment, control, and prevention. In this review we will discuss progression of Lassa virus diagnostics from the past and into the future.

	abstract = {Lassa fever (LF) is a zoonotic disease that is widespread in West Africa and involves animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission. Animal-to-human transmission occurs upon exposure to rodent excreta and secretions, i.e. urine and saliva, and human-to-human transmission occurs via the bodily fluids of an infected person. To elucidate the seasonal drivers of LF epidemics, we employed a mathematical model to analyse the datasets of human infection, rodent population dynamics and climatological variations and capture the underlying transmission dynamics. The surveillance-based incidence data of human cases in Nigeria were explored, and moreover, a mathematical model was used for describing the transmission dynamics of LF in rodent populations. While quantifying the case fatality risk and the rate of exposure of humans to animals, we explicitly estimated the corresponding contact rate of humans with infected rodents, accounting for the seasonal population dynamics of rodents. Our findings reveal that seasonal migratory dynamics of rodents play a key role in regulating the cyclical pattern of LF epidemics. The estimated timing of high exposure of humans to animals coincides with the time shortly after the start of the dry season and can be associated with the breeding season of rodents in Nigeria.

Because no vaccine exists and therapeutic options are limited, preventing infection through rodent control and human behavioural measures is currently considered to be the only option. In order to assess the efficacy of rodent control, we performed a 4-year field experiment in rural Upper Guinea and developed a mathematical model to simulate different control strategies (annual density control, continuous density control, and rodent vaccination). For the field study, rodenticide baits were placed each year in three rural villages, while three other villages were used as controls. Rodents were trapped before and after every treatment and their antibody status and age were determined. Data from the field study were used to parameterize the mathematical model. In the field study, we found a significant negative effect of rodent control on seroprevalence, but this effect was small especially given the effort. Furthermore, the rodent populations recovered rapidly after rodenticide application, leading us to conclude that an annual control strategy is unlikely to significantly reduce Lassa virus spillover to humans. In agreement with this finding, the mathematical model suggests that the use of continuous control or rodent vaccination is the only strategy that could lead to Lassa virus elimination. These field and model results can serve as a guide for determining how long and frequent rodent control should be done in order to eliminate Lassa virus in rural villages.},

	abstract = {Lassa fever virus (LASV) causes acute viral haemorrhagic fever with symptoms similar to those seen with Ebola virus infections. LASV is endemic to West Africa and is transmitted through contact with excretions of infected Mastomys natalensis rodents and other rodent species. Due to a high fatality rate, lack of treatment options and difficulties with prevention and control, LASV is one of the high-priority pathogens included in the WHO R\&D Blueprint. The WHO LASV vaccine strategy relies on availability of effective diagnostic tests. Current diagnostics for LASV include in-house and commercial (primarily research-only) laboratory-based serological and nucleic acid amplification tests. There are two commercially available (for research use only) rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), and a number of multiplex panels for differential detection of LASV infection from other endemic diseases with similar symptoms have been evaluated. However, a number of diagnostic gaps remain. Lineage detection is a challenge due to the genomic diversity of LASV, as pan-lineage sensitivity for both molecular and immunological detection is necessary for surveillance and outbreak response. While pan-lineage ELISA and RDTs are commercially available (for research use only), validation and external quality assessment (EQA) is needed to confirm detection sensitivity for all known or relevant strains. Variable sensitivity of LASV PCR tests also highlights the need for improved validation and EQA. Given that LASV outbreaks typically occur in low-resource settings, more options for point-of-care testing would be valuable. These requirements should be taken into account in target product profiles for improved LASV diagnostics.},

Although rodent surveys could help to assess the circulation of T. gondii, they have seldom been set up in sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of this study was to examine Toxoplasma seroprevalence in rodents from villages and towns across Senegal. Rodents were sampled in 40 localities using a standardised trapping protocol. Detection of T. gondii antibodies was performed on 1205 rodents, using a modified agglutination test (MAT) technique. Seroprevalence data were analysed depending on geography, the local rodent community, and individual characteristics of the rodent hosts. We found 44 seropositive rodents from four different species (Mastomys erythroleucus, Mastomys natalensis, Mus musculus domesticus, Rattus rattus). Toxoplasma seroprevalence was low, averaging 4\% in the localities. Higher Toxoplasma seroprevalence (up to 24\%) was found in northern Senegal, a region known to be the heart of pastoral herding in the country. Copyright © C.

We characterized the evolutionary relationships among multiple Schistosoma mansoni isolates collected from snails (intermediate hosts), humans (definitive hosts), and rodents (definitive hosts) in Senegal. On a local scale, diagnosis of S. mansoni infection ranged 3.8\%-44.8\% in school-aged children, 1.7\%-52.6\% in Mastomys huberti mice, and 1.8\%-7.1\% in Biomphalaria pfeifferi snails. Our phylogenetic framework confirmed the presence of multiple S. mansoni lineages that could infect both humans and rodents; divergence times of these lineages varied (0.13-0.02 million years ago). We propose that extensive movement of persons across West Africa might have contributed to the establishment of these various multihost S. mansoni clades. High S. mansoni prevalence in rodents at transmission sites frequented by humans further highlights the implications that alternative hosts could have on future public health interventions.},

In doing so, we document extant species distributions, which highlight the risks of continuing the range expansion of three synanthropic invasive rodent species, namely black rats (Rattus rattus), brown rats (R. norvegicus), and house mice (Mus musculus). Using various diversity estimates and community ecology approaches, we detect a latitudinal gradient of species richness that significantly decreased Northward. We show that shrews (Crocidura) represent a very important component of micro-mammal fauna in West African towns and villages, especially at lower latitudes. We also demonstrate that invasive and native synanthropic rodents do not distribute randomly in West Africa, which suggests that invasive species dynamics and history differ markedly, and that they involve gradual, as well as human-mediated, long distance dispersal. Patterns of segregation are also observed between native Mastomys natalensis and invasive rats R. rattus and R. norvegicus, suggesting potential native-to-invasive species turn over. Consequences of such processes, especially in terms of public health, are discussed.},

	doi = {10.1007/s10460-019-09939-w},
	abstract = {Burrowing mammals are ubiquitous on farms in South Africa and can hinder agricultural practices. This study explored farmer perspectives of these species, and specifically the factors that influence these perspectives. Forty-four farmers responded to a questionnaire that assessed their ecological knowledge of, tolerance towards and lethal management of burrowing mammals that occur on their farms. The results from generalised linear models showed that neither farmer age, nor level of education are accurate predictors of ecological knowledge, overall tolerance towards burrowers, or their lethal management. Knowledge of burrowing mammals showed a significant relationship with tolerance, with more knowledgeable individuals displaying higher levels of tolerance. However, a farmer's overall tolerance towards burrowing species did not affect the number of species managed. Our results also suggest that different values are attached to different species when it comes to lethal management. Thus, farmers commonly controlled the numbers of the problem rodent species, Highveld gerbil (Gerbilliscus brantsii) and Cape ground squirrel (Xerus inauris), but were less likely to manage black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas) and warthog (Phacochoerus africanus), even when experiencing these as problematic. We suggest that the larger, more charismatic species possibly evoke more sympathy from farmers. Agro-ecosystems are likely to become increasingly important for conservation in the future, and we encourage continued studies on the environmental attitudes and approaches of agricultural practitioners as a means to understanding the current status and future trends in ecologically sustainable agriculture.},

They are abundant in a variety of open habitats, they are major agricultural pests, and they became a popular model in physiological research because of their diurnal activity. Despite this importance, information about their taxonomy and distribution is unsatisfactory, especially in eastern Africa. In this study, we collected the most comprehensive multilocus DNA dataset to date across the geographic and taxonomic range of the genus (229 genotyped specimens from 130 localities in 16 countries belonging to all currently recognized species). We reconstructed phylogenetic relationships, mapped the distribution of major genetic clades, and used the combination of cytogenetic, nuclear, and mitochondrial markers for species delimitations and taxonomic suggestions. The genus is composed of two major evolutionary groups, called here the ANSORGEI and NILOTICUS groups. The former contains four presumed species, while the latter is more diverse and we recognized nine species. Most relationships among species are not resolved, which suggests a rapid radiation (dated to early-middle Pleistocene). Further, there is an indication of reticulate evolution in Ethiopia, that is, the region of the highest Arvicanthis diversity. The distribution of genetic diversity suggests diversification in eastern Africa, followed by repeated dispersals to the west (Sudano-Guinean savannas) and to the south (Masai steppe). We propose nomenclatural changes for Ethiopian taxa and provide suggestions for future steps toward solving remaining taxonomic questions in the genus.},

	abstract = {Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness caused by Lassa virus (LASV), which is endemic throughout much of West Africa. The virus primarily circulates in the Mastomys natalensis reservoir and is transmitted to humans through contact with infectious rodents or their secretions; human-to-human transmission is documented as well. With the exception of Dengue fever, LASV has the highest human impact of any haemorrhagic fever virus. On-going outbreaks in Nigeria have resulted in unprecedented mortality. Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has listed LASV as a high priority pathogen for the development of treatments and prophylactics. Currently, there are no licensed vaccines to protect against LASV infection. Although numerous candidates have demonstrated efficacy in animal models, to date, only a single candidate has advanced to clinical trials. Lassa fever vaccine development efforts have been hindered by the high cost of biocontainment requirements, the absence of established correlates of protection, and uncertainty regarding the extent to which animal models are predictive of vaccine efficacy in humans. This review briefly discusses the epidemiology and biology of LASV infection and highlights recent progress in vaccine development.},

This viral zoonosis was introduced into the United States in 2003 via African rodents imported for the pet trade and caused 37 human cases, all linked to exposure to MPXV-infected black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). Prairie dogs have since become a useful model of MPXV disease, utilized for testing of potential medical countermeasures. In this study, we used recombinant MPXV containing the firefly luciferase gene (luc) and in vivo imaging technology to characterize MPXV pathogenesis in the black-tailed prairie dog in real time. West African (WA) MPXV could be visualized using in vivo imaging in the nose, lymph nodes, intestines, heart, lung, kidneys, and liver as early as day 6 post infection (p.i.). By day 9 p.i., lesions became visible on the skin and in some cases in the spleen. After day 9 p.i., luminescent signal representing MPXV replication either increased, indicating a progression to what would be a fatal infection, or decreased as infection was resolved. Use of recombinant luc+ MPXV allowed for a greater understanding of how MPXV disseminates throughout the body in prairie dogs during the course of infection. This technology will be used to reduce the number of animals required in future pathogenesis studies as well as aid in determining the effectiveness of potential medical countermeasures.},

In 1969, a series of sequential life-threating or fatal infections occurred among health care workers in Nigeria and the laboratory scientist who isolated and characterized the causative agent. The agent, Lassa virus was named after the geographical location of the first recognized human case. The new virus was shown to be related to lymphocytic choriomeningitis and to previously unclassified neotropical viruses, including Argentine and Bolivian hemorrhagic fevers, and a new taxonomic grouping, the Arenaviruses, was proposed. In 1970-72, three further epidemics occurred in Nigeria, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the first two involved nosocomial transmission, and the third was a community-based outbreak, during which the rodent reservoir host was identified. In 1976, a long-term research project commenced in Sierra Leone, which produced a rich body of data from prospectively designed studies on the clinical features, transmission, and treatment of the disease.},

	abstract = {Toxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic protozoan with a worldwide occurrence, but the determinants of the current pattern in the geographical distribution of T. gondii lineages and strains remain poorly understood. To test the influence of human trade on T. gondii populations, we conducted a population genetic study of 72 T. gondii animal isolates from Senegal, a West African country in which the ongoing inland progress of invasive murine hosts (introduced in port cities of Senegal since the 16(th) century by European sailors) is well described. Isolates were mainly collected on free-range poultry, which are considered as relevant bioindicators of T. gondii strain diversity in the domestic environment. Sampling was conducted in two port cities of Senegal (Dakar and Saint-Louis) and in one inland region (Kedougou). Population genetic analyses using 15 microsatellite markers revealed different patterns between port cities where lineages non-virulent for mice (type II, type III, and Africa 4) were predominant, and Kedougou where the mouse-virulent Africa 1 lineage was the most common. By considering the current spatial pattern in the inland progress of invasive rodents in Senegal, our results suggest that the invasive house mouse Mus musculus domesticus counter-selects the Africa 1 lineage in the invaded areas. The comparison of the microsatellite alleles of type II strains from Senegal to type II strains from other areas in Africa and Western Europe, using discriminant analysis of principal components and Network analysis, point to a mainly Western European origin of the type II lineage in Senegal. Collectively, these findings suggest that human-mediated intercontinental migrations of murine hosts are important vectors of T. gondii strains. Differential susceptibility of endemic and introduced murine hosts to various T. gondii strains probably determines the persistence of these strains in the environment, and therefore their availability for human and animal infection. Author summary Toxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic protozoan with a worldwide distribution and which can infects virtually all warm-blooded species, including human. Clinical expression of human toxoplasmosis, as well as T. gondii strains diversity, exhibit contrasting patterns across geographic regions. The determinants of this geographical structure are poorly understood, but a growing body of evidence supports an important role of human-mediated migrations of T. gondii hosts in the intercontinental dissemination of some parasite lineages. The results of our study conducted in Senegal suggest that the invasive house mouse-which was introduced in the port cities of this country through maritime trade since colonial times-has a dramatic influence on the T. gondii populations of invaded areas. This important T. gondii reservoir seems to be a vector for the intercontinental migrations of T. gondii. In addition, it may have a role in the selection (or the counter-selection) of local T. gondii populations found in invaded areas. This study provides insights into the mechanisms shaping T. gondii populations, thereby determining which strains will be available for human and animal infection.},

Wild and laboratory rat-induced Seoul infections have, however, been described since the early eighties, due to the omnipresence of the rodent reservoir, the brown rat Rattus norvegicus. Recent studies showed no fundamental differences between the pathogenicity and phylogeny of pet rat-induced Seoul orthohantaviruses and their formerly described wild or laboratory rat counterparts. The paucity of diagnosed Seoul virus-induced disease in the West is in striking contrast to the thousands of cases recorded since the 1980s in the Far East, particularly in China. This review of four continents (Asia, Europe, America, and Africa) puts this "emerging infection" into a historical perspective, concluding there is an urgent need for greater medical awareness of Seoul virus-induced human pathology in many parts of the world. Given the mostly milder and atypical clinical presentation, sometimes even with preserved normal kidney function, the importance of simple but repeated urine examination is stressed, since initial but transient proteinuria and microhematuria are rarely lacking.},

The underlying factors driving this consumption are, however, relatively understudied, particularly among rural households, and improved understanding would facilitate the development of conservation strategies. We therefore aimed to identify the factors that influence bushmeat consumption in rural households to the west of Tai National Park, in Cote d'Ivoire. We carried out enquiries in a total of 144 rural households in 20 localities during July-December 2012. Bushmeat, the majority of which comprised rodents and bovids, accounted for 13\% of the animal protein consumed in these households. This consumption was significantly higher in households in which poverty was more acute (low annual income and more dependent children). We found that repeated awareness campaigns involving theatre performances and/or film screenings (multimedia campaigns) contributed to a decrease in bushmeat consumption. This decrease exceeded 62\% after exposure to four multimedia campaigns. We highlight the importance of awareness campaigns for reducing consumption of wild animals, and demonstrate the importance of recurring multimedia campaigns to maximize the impact of such conservation activities in rural communities.},

The occurrence and zoonotic potential of Plagiorchis spp. have been characterised across several countries in Asia; in contrast, information on Plagiorchis parasites in Africa remains anecdotal. We isolated a previously undescribed Plagiorchis species from the biliary tract and small intestine of 201 out of 427 small mammals collected in the region of Lake Guiers, Senegal, with local prevalence ranging from 38.6\% to 77.0\%. Conversely, Plagiorchis isolates were not observed in the 244 small mammals sampled in and around the town of Richard Toll, Senegal. Molecular phylogenetics of the internal transcribed spacer region, nuclear ribosomal DNA, and of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene, mitochondrial DNA, supported the monophyly and multi-host spectrum of this newly discovered West African Plagiorchis species. Sequencing of individual cercariae shed by Radix natalensis (Gastropoda: Lymnaeidae) suggested that these freshwater snails may act as suitable first intermediate hosts. Phylogenetic analysis yielded a highly resolved topology indicating two different clades, one composed by Plagiorchis spp. infecting rodents, insectivores, and birds, while the other included parasites of bats. Our findings showed the low host specificity and high prevalence of the isolated Plagiorchis sp. in the Lake Guiers region, with Hubert's multimammate mice (Mastomys huberti) appearing to play a primary role in the epidemiology of this parasite. The results raise concern about the zoonotic potential of Plagiorchis sp. in local communities of the Lake Guiers region, and highlight food-borne trematodiases and their link to land-use change as a neglected public health issue in regions of West Africa.},

Since its discovery in 1959, the virus has been isolated from birds, arthropods and humans in Europe and Africa. An increasing number of Usutu virus infections in humans with neurological presentations have been reported. Recently, the virus has been detected in bats and horses, which deviates from the currently proposed enzootic cycle of USUV involving several different avian and mosquito species. Despite this increasing number of viral detections in different mammalian hosts, the existence of a non-avian reservoir remains unresolved. In Kedougou, a tropical region in the southeast corner of Senegal, Usutu virus was detected, isolated and sequenced from five asymptomatic small mammals: Two different rodent species and a single species of shrew. Additional molecular characterization and in vivo growth dynamics showed that these rodents/shrew-derived viruses are closely related to the reference strain (accession number: AF013412) and are as pathogenic as other characterized strains associated with neurological invasions in human. This is the first evidence of Usutu virus isolation from rodents or shrews. Our findings emphasize the need to consider a closer monitoring of terrestrial small mammals in future active surveillance, public health, and epidemiological efforts in response to USUV in both Africa and Europe.},

	abstract = {Aim Vertebrate diversity in the Guineo-Congolian forests (GCF) of Africa is high, yet mechanisms responsible for generating that diversity remain remarkably understudied. These forests have alternatively been viewed as centres of diversification ("cradles") or more recently, as the opposite ("museums"). Here, we use a comparative dataset of avian and mammalian species to examine genetic diversification patterns across these forests and use these results to explain observed patterns in light of Plio-Pleistocene climatic change and life-history. Location Africa. Methods We analysed patterns of diversification across the GCF using a dataset composed of 629 and 1,048 mitochondrial sequences from 60 avian and 36 mammalian species, respectively. Uncorrected pairwise genetic distances were compared at three distinct geographical levels: west versus east of the Dahomey Gap, among the three major forest blocks, and among seven historical refugial areas. The timing of diversification was assessed for passerines, Rodentia, and Chiroptera. Results We found substantial signatures of diversification in all three levels of our geographical comparisons. We recovered substantial disparity in the amount and depth of structure of diversification patterns between low dispersers (understorey birds and rodents) and more capable dispersers (other bird species and bats). Additionally, our chronogram recovered recent speciation and intraspecific diversification across songbird and mammalian lineages. Main conclusions The discrete, and often deep, structuring of genetic diversification for both birds and mammals across the GCF revealed strong correlations between historic landscape fragmentation and dispersal ability. Our results revealed a striking amount of unrecognized genetic diversity, which may be suggestive of cryptic species. Given the rate at which these forests are being negatively impacted by human intervention, our general lack of knowledge concerning vertebrate diversity across these forests may very well impact our ability to identify evolutionary processes underlying diversity and enact meaningful conservation efforts in the future.},

LASV is transmitted to humans from naturally infected rodents. At present, there is not an effective vaccine nor treatment. The genetic diversity of LASV is the greatest challenge for vaccine development. The reassortant ML29 carrying the L segment from the nonpathogenic Mopeia virus (MOPV) and the S segment from LASV is a vaccine candidate under current development. ML29 demonstrated complete protection in validated animal models against a Nigerian strain from clade II, which was responsible for the worst outbreak on record in 2018. This study demonstrated that ML29 was more attenuated than MOPV in STAT1(-/-) mice, a small animal model of human LF and its sequelae. ML29 infection of these mice resulted in more than a thousand-fold reduction in viremia and viral load in tissues and strong LASV-specific adaptive T cell responses compared to MOPV-infected mice. Persistent infection of Vero cells with ML29 resulted in generation of interfering particles (IPs), which strongly interfered with the replication of LASV, MOPV and LCMV, the prototype of the Arenaviridae. ML29 IPs induced potent cell-mediated immunity and were fully attenuated in STAT1(-/-) mice. Formulation of ML29 with IPs will improve the breadth of the host's immune responses and further contribute to development of a pan-LASV vaccine with full coverage meeting the WHO requirements.},

Recently, different rodent species carrying diverse lineages of the Lassa virus (LASV) in addition to a novel Mobala-like genetic sequence were detected within the country. Here, screening 906 small mammal specimens from 11 localities for IgG antibodies and incorporating previous PCR detection data involving the same populations, we further describe arenavirus prevalence across Nigeria in relation to host species and geographical location. Methods: Small mammals were trapped during the period 2011-2015 according to geographical location (endemic and non endemic zones for Lassa fever), season (rainy and dry seasons between 2011 and 2012 for certain localities) and habitat (indoois, peridomestic settings and sylvatic vegetation). identification of animal specimens from genera such as Mastomys and Mus (Nannomys) was assisted by DNA sequencing. Small mammals were tested for LASV IgG antibody using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Results: Small mammals were infected in both the endemic and non-endemic zones for Lassa fever, with a wider range of species IgG-positive (n = 8) than those which had been previously detected to be PCR-positive (n = 3). IgG-positive species, according to number of infected individuals, were Mastomys natalensis (n = 40), Mastomys erythroleucus (n = 15), Praomys daltoni (n = 6), Mus baoulei (n = 5), Rattus rattus (n = 2), Crocidura spp. (n = 2), Mus minutoides (n = 1) and Praomys misonnei (n = 1). Multimammate mice (Mastomys natalensis and M. erythroleucus) were the most ubiquitously infected, with animals testing positive by either PCR or IgG in 7 out of the 11 localities sampled IgG prevalence in M. natalensis ranged from 1\% in Abagboro, 17-36\% in Eguare Egoro, Ekpoma and Ngel Nyaki, up to 52 \% in Mayo Ranewo. Prevalence according to locality, season and age was not, however, statistically significant for M. natalensis in Eguare Egoro and Ekpoma, localities that were sampled longitudinally. Conclusions: Overall, our study demonstrates that arenavirus occurrence is probably more widely distributed geographically and in extent of host taxa than is currently realized. This expanded scope should be taken into consideration in Lassa fever control efforts. further sampling should also be carried out to isolate and characterize potential arenaviruses present in small mammal populations we found to be seropositive.},

Rodents are prominent invasive species, and act as reservoirs in many zoonotic infectious diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the link between the distribution and spread of two parasite taxa (Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma lewisi) and the progressive invasion of Senegal by two commensal rodent species (the house mouse Mus musculus domesticus and the black rat Rattus rattus). M. m. domesticus and R. rattus have invaded the northern part and the central/ southern part of the country, respectively. Native and invasive rodents were caught in villages and cities along the invasion gradients of both invaders, from coastal localities towards the interior of the land. Molecular diagnosis of the two trypanosomatid infections was performed using spleen specimens. In the north, neither M. m. domesticus nor the native species were carriers of these parasites. Conversely, in the south, 17.5\% of R. rattus were infected by L. major and 27.8\% by T. lewisi, while very few commensal native rodents were carriers. Prevalence pattern along invasion gradients, together with the knowledge on the geographical distribution of the parasites, suggested that the presence of the two parasites in R. rattus in Senegal is of different origins. Indeed, the invader R. rattus could have been locally infected by the native parasite L. major. Conversely, it could have introduced the exotic parasite T. lewisi in Senegal, the latter appearing to be poorly transmitted to native rodents. Altogether, these data show that R. rattus is a carrier of both parasites and could be responsible for the emergence of new foci of cutaneous leishmaniasis, or for the transmission of atypical human trypanosomiasis in Senegal.},

Our study focused on the plague-endemic West Nile region of Uganda, where a majority of residents live in Uganda government-defined poverty, rely on subsistence farming for a living, and frequently experience incursions of rodents into their homes. In this study, we show that rodent removal was achieved in a median of 6 days of intensive lethal trapping with multiple trap types (range: 0-16 days). However, rodent abundance in 68.9\% of homesteads returned to pretreatment levels within a median of 8 weeks (range 1-24 weeks), and at least a single rodent was captured in all homesteads by a median of 2 weeks (range 1-16 weeks) after removal efforts were terminated. Results were similar between homesteads that practiced rodent control whether or not their neighbors implemented similar strategies.

This is the case of Kafue National Park (KNP), Zambia, where mechanisms supporting coexistence among rodent and shrew species remain unclear, much less the influence of fire on their dietary resource use. Here, we use stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes to assess dietary resource use and partitioning among rodents and shrews found in three vegetation formations of KNP. According to the nitrogen isotope signatures, rodents are one to two trophic levels above primary production, save for Mus triton that is above by two to three. Shrews are two trophic levels above primary production. Among shrews, factors allowing coexistence of similar sized species could not be resolved. Rodent species of the same assemblage either differ in body mass by a factor of two (following Hutchinson's rule) or similar sized species occupy different trophic levels or dietary guilds based on their isotopic nitrogen or carbon signatures. At sites with frequent fires, rodents have broader dietary niches than at sites with low fire frequencies. This could either indicate relaxed competition under high fire frequencies as rodent populations do not reach the carrying capacity of the habitat, or it could reflect reduced competition due to lower species numbers under high versus low fire recurrence regimes. The results indicate competition as an important component structuring rodent communities in Zambian savannas, thus suggesting limited resources.},

	abstract = {Background: In mammals and across rat species, the variation in conformation is markedly observed in the head and the variation in the shape of the head is mostly determined by the shape of the skull. Hence comparative topographic analysis and morphometry is a veritable tool in precise categorization of peri-domestic rats and species identification. Methods: Killed rodents around residential dwellings of students on campus were collected and measurements taken of external morphology. Thirty-one external head and corporal parameters; and 40 cranial measurements respectively were obtained. Topographic features and specific anatomical landmarks measured were matched using congruent anatomical landmarks and compared to referenced standard measurements. Results: External morphometry suggests that all retrieved samples were more closely related to the species Rattus rattus. However, craniodental analysis of captured rats reveals variations from the mean of typical R. rattus. In comparison with Mastomys natalensis, the mean averages of the rat species were perceptibly different for only two of the parameters viz palatine fissure length (PL) (p = 0.039) and distance between interparietal bone (DP) (p = 0.06). In contrast, the mean of whole length of skull (WL), length of diastema (PI), length of nasal bone (NL), length of frontal bone (LF) and occipital width (OH) were significantly different from that of R. rattus with p values of 0.047, 0.036, 0.048, 0.032 and 0.034 respectively. Conclusion: This study focuses on peridomestic rat's identification within the University campus based on morphometry, providing unique landmarks for differentiation between Mastomys, Mus, Rattus and other rat species with emphasis on the need for more comprehensive investigation, categorization and morphometric profiling of rat population in Nigeria. Metric data generated for rat profiling in Nigeria is pivotal for a more comprehensive strategy for prevention of Lassa fever. (C) 2017 The Authors.

In this short communication, we present our findings for favipiravir in cell culture and in mice, while an accompanying paper presents the results of NHP studies. We confirmed previous reports that favipiravir has anti-EBOV activity in mice. Additionally, we found that the active form of favipiravir is generated in mice in tissues relevant for the pathogenesis of EBOV infection. Finally, we observed that protection can be achieved in mice down to 8 mg/kg/day, which is lower than the dosing regimens previously reported.

Data are analyzed in terms of habitat preferences of individual species, community composition and species richness. Results of dietary analysis are presented. The data indicate that the rodent fauna of cocoa groves contains both savanna-derived and forest-derived elements, though some habitat specialist species were absent. Habitats with a high percentage of understory cover showed a higher rodent species diversity and biomass than those with a sparse understory. The habitats contained 43\% of the predicted small mammal fauna, including 33\% of the forest-dwelling species. Missing species were mostly arboreal forms. Cocoa groves may provide important refugia for forestderived small mammal species in areas where deforestation has been extensive.},

	abstract = {Rodent pests are especially problematic in terms of agriculture and public health since they can inflict considerable economic damage associated with their abundance, diversity, generalist feeding habits and high reproductive rates. To quantify rodent pest impacts and identify trends in rodent pest research impacting on small-holder agriculture in the Afro-Malagasy region we did a systematic review of research outputs from 1910 to 2015, by developing an a priori defined set of criteria to allow for replication of the review process. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We reviewed 162 publications, and while rodent pest research was spatially distributed across Africa (32 countries, including Madagascar), there was a disparity in number of studies per country with research biased towards four countries (Tanzania [25\%], Nigeria [9\%], Ethiopia [9\%], Kenya [8\%]) accounting for 51\% of all rodent pest research in the Afro-Malagasy region. There was a disparity in the research themes addressed by Tanzanian publications compared to publications from the rest of the Afro-Malagasy region where research in Tanzania had a much more applied focus (50\%) compared to a more basic research approach (92\%) in the rest of the Afro-Malagasy region. We found that pest rodents have a significant negative effect on the Afro-Malagasy small-holder farming communities. Crop losses varied between cropping stages, storage and crops and the highest losses occurred during early cropping stages (46\% median loss during seedling stage) and the mature stage (15\% median loss). There was a scarcity of studies investigating the effectiveness of various management actions on rodent pest damage and population abundance. Our analysis highlights that there are inadequate empirical studies focused on developing sustainable control methods for rodent pests and rodent pests in the Africa-Malagasy context is generally ignored as a research topic.},

Fifty individuals of nine species of rodents were recorded, with Mastomys erythroleucus (multimammate mouse) being the most abundant. Small mammal species diversity was highest (H’ = 1.88) and lowest (H’ = 0.98) in Tain II and Tain I forest reserves, respectively. The presence of some savanna species in some of the reserves indicated high levels of degradation. Fifty-four bird species, representing 22 families, were recorded, with 16 of the species being under national conservation protection. It is recommended that the reserves be zoned into smaller management areas to enable more efficient management, through initiation of reforestation programmes, anti-poaching patrols, research, and long-term monitoring.

Despite these benefits, snakes are historically a target of persecution and negative attitudes across cultures, and many of them are threatened. Understanding the predictors of snake-human conflicts is essential to improve conservation efforts. We investigated the degree to which emotions, myth beliefs, experience with snakes (via exposure, bites, and knowledge of mortality from a snakebite), and education would predict attitudes toward snakes in a sample of southeastern Nigerian people. We further examined whether attitudes would predict intentional killing of snakes. Ordinal regression analyses revealed that fear, disgust, and belief in the myth that snakes are evil were related to low tolerance of snakes. More frequent encounters with snakes and higher education were associated with higher tolerance of snakes. Furthermore, higher tolerance of snakes was associated with a reduced likelihood of intentionally killing snakes, even when controlling for the influence of the other psychological and experiential variables. Wildlife management education interventions may be important to change attitudes and decrease intentional killing of snakes.},

In contrast to the situation with arenaviruses, the presence of other viruses in M. natalensis remains largely unexplored. In this study, herpesviruses and polyomaviruses were identified and partially characterized by PCR methods, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. In tissues sampled from M. natalensis populations in Cote d'Ivoire and Mali, six new DNA viruses (four betaherpesviruses, one gammaherpesvirus and one polyomavirus) were identified. Phylogenetic analysis based on glycoprotein B amino acid sequences showed that the herpesviruses clustered with cytomegaloviruses and rhadinoviruses of multiple rodent species. The complete circular genome of the newly identified polyomavirus was amplified by PCR. Amino acid sequence analysis of the large T antigen or VP1 showed that this virus clustered with a known polyomavirus from a house mouse (species Mus musculus polyomavirus 1). These two polyomaviruses form a clade with other rodent polyomaviruses, and the newly identified virus represents the third known polyomavirus of M. natalensis. This study represents the first identification of herpesviruses and the discovery of a novel polyomavirus in M. natalensis. In contrast to arenaviruses, we anticipate that these newly identified viruses represent a low zoonotic risk due to the normally highly restricted specificity of members of these two DNA virus families to their individual mammalian host species.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Lassa virus (LASV), the causative agent of lassa fever (LF), an endemic acute viral haemorrhagic illness in Nigeria, is transmitted by direct contact with the rodent, contaminated food or household items. Person-to-person transmission also occurs and sexual transmission has been reported. Thus, this study investigated the presence of LASV in body fluids of suspected and confirmed cases. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study between March 2018 and April 2019 involving 112 consenting suspected and post ribavirin confirmed cases attending the lassa fever treatment center in Ondo State. Whole blood was collected from 57 suspected and 29 confirmed cases. Other samples from confirmed cases were 5 each of High Vaginal Swab (HVS) and seminal fluid; 12 breast milk and 4 urine. All samples were analyzed using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) targeting the S-gene of LASV. Results: Analysis of whole blood by RT-PCR showed that 1/57 (1.8\%) suspected and 1/29 (3.4\%) confirmed post ribavirin treated cases were positive. While LASV was detected in 2/5 (40\%) post ribavirin treated seminal fluids and 1/11 (8.3\%) breast milk. However, LASV was not detected in any of the HVS and urine samples. Conclusion: The detection of LASV in seminal fluid and breast milk of discharged post ribavirin treated cases suggests its persistence in these fluids of recovering Nigerians. The role of postnatal and sexual transmissions in the perennial outbreak of LF needs to be further evaluated.},

	abstract = {Lassa mammarenavirus (LASV) is a rodent-borne arenavirus endemic to several West African countries. It is the causative agent of human Lassa fever, an acute viral hemorrhagic fever disease. To date, no therapeutics or vaccines against LASV have obtained regulatory approval. Polyclonal neutralizing antibodies derived from hyperimmunized animals may offer a useful strategy for prophylactic and therapeutic intervention to combat human LASV infections. The LASV envelope surface glycoprotein complex (GP) is the major target for neutralizing antibodies, and it is the main viral antigen used for the design of an LASV vaccine. Here, we assessed the immunogenic potential of mammalian cell-derived virus-like particles (VLPs) expressing GP from the prototypic LASV strain Josiah in a native-like conformation as the sole viral antigen. We demonstrate that an adjuvanted prime-boost immunization regimen with GP-derived VLPs elicited neutralizing antibody responses in rabbits, suggesting that effective antigenic epitopes of GP were displayed. Notably, these antibodies exhibited broad reactivity across five genetic lineages of LASV. VLP-based immunization strategies may represent a powerful approach for generating polyclonal sera containing cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against LASV.},

	abstract = {The presence and detection of common airborne fungi in an area are important for the prevention and treatment of allergic fungal diseases. Because of the ubiquitous nature of fungi, the effect of four different fungal species in production of antioxidant and reactive oxygen species production in balb/c albino mice was investigated. Fifty-four balb/c mice were randomly divided into eight groups (n = 6) and a normal control group. Four different fungal plates, comprising Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus penicillioides, Penicillium citrinum, and Penicillium chrysogenum, which were the most abundant fungi species sampled in the environment were cultured for one week to make 2.3 x 107 and 3.2 x 105 spores and injected intranasally in sterile saline into the nostrils of each of the mice. Results showed that all fungal inoculated organism produced statistically (P{\textless}0.05) significant reactive oxygen species while antioxidant parameters were significantly decreased in a dose dependent manner compared with normal control mice. It is therefore concluded that Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus penicillioides, Penicillium citrinum, and Penicillium chrysogenum can alter and decrease immune function in balb/c mice. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify the most common airborne fungal species present in Southwest Nigeria and to study their allergic reactions.},

Here, we sequenced multiple complete genomes of dromedary camel coronavirus HKU23 (DcCoV-HKU23) from Nigeria, Morocco, and Ethiopia and identified several genomic positions indicative of cross-species virus recombination events among other betacoronaviruses of the subgenus Embecovirus (clade A beta-CoVs). Recombinant fragments of a rabbit coronavirus (RbCoV-HKU14) were identified at the hemagglutinin esterase gene position. Homolog fragments of a rodent CoV were also observed at 8.9-kDa open reading frame 4a at the 3' end of the spike gene. The patterns of recombination differed geographically across the African region, highlighting a mosaic structure of DcCoV-HKU23 genomes circulating in dromedaries. Our results highlighted active recombination of coronaviruses circulating in dromedaries and are also relevant to the emergence and evolution of other betacoronaviruses, including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). IMPORTANCE: Genetic recombination is often demonstrated in coronaviruses and can result in host range expansion or alteration in tissue tropism. Here, we showed interspecies events of recombination of an endemic dromedary camel coronavirus, HKU23, with other clade A betacoronaviruses. Our results supported the possibility that the zoonotic pathogen MERS-CoV, which also cocirculates in the same camel species, may have undergone similar recombination events facilitating its emergence or may do so in its future evolution.},

Population growth and demographic shifts over the years have increased contact with these mammals, thereby increasing opportunities for disease transmission.

To investigate human seroprevalence of selected rodent-borne pathogens, sera from 657 healthy adults in ten rural communities in Ghana were analyzed. An in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to Lassa virus was positive in 34 (5\%) of the human samples. Using commercial kits, antibodies to hantavirus serotypes, Puumala and Dobrava, and Leptospira bacteria were detected in 11\%, 12\% and 21\% of the human samples, respectively. Forty percent of residents in rural farming communities in Ghana have measurable antibodies to at least one of the rodent-borne pathogens tested, including antibodies to viral hemorrhagic fever viruses. The high seroprevalence found in rural Ghana to rodent-borne pathogens associated with both sporadic cases and larger disease outbreaks will help define disease threats and inform public health policy to reduce disease burden in underserved populations and deter larger outbreaks.},

The ookinete surface protein P25 is a primary target for TBV development, but heterologous expression of P25 with appropriate conformation is problematic and a pre-requisite for achieving functional titers. A potential alternative to recombinant/sub-unit vaccine is immunization with a non-pathogenic, whole-parasite vaccine. This study examines the ability of a purified transgenic rodent-malaria parasite (PbPfs25DR3), expressing Plasmodium falciparum P25 in native conformation on the P. berghei ookinete surface, to act as a TBV. Vaccination with purified PbPfs25DR3 ookinetes produces a potent anti-Pfs25 response and high transmission-blocking efficacy in the laboratory, findings that are then translated to experimentation on natural field isolates of P. falciparum from infected individuals in Burkina Faso. Efficacy is demonstrated in the lab and the field (up to 93.3\%/97.1\% reductions in transmission intensity respectively), with both a homologous strategy with one and two boosts, and as part of a prime-boost regime, providing support for the future development of a whole-parasite TBV.},

The overall infection rate was 12.2\% (9/74) and Cryptosporidium infection had no significant association (P{\textgreater}0.05) with sex, age and management practices. Sequencing of the small-subunit rRNA gene identified Cryptosporidium muris as the only genotype infecting the grasscutters. These findings suggest that grasscutters may harbour Cryptosporidium species with potential public health consequences since C. muris has been implicated in human infections. It is therefore recommended that precautions be taken while processing the rodent meat for human consumption to avoid zoonotic infection. This is the first report on molecular identification of Cryptosporidium species in the grasscutter.},

In the past decade, the number of reports on atypical human cases due to Trypanosoma lewisi or T. lewisi-like has increased urging to investigate the multiple factors driving the disease dynamics, particularly in cities where rodents and humans co-exist at high densities. In the present survey, we used a species distribution model, Maxent, to assess the spatial pattern of Trypanosoma-positive rodents in the city of Niamey. The explanatory variables were landscape metrics describing urban landscape composition and physiognomy computed from 8 land-cover classes. We computed the metrics around each data location using a set of circular buffers of increasing radii (20 m, 40 m, 60 m, 80 m and 100 m). For each spatial resolution, we determined the optimal combination of feature class and regularization multipliers by fitting Maxent with the full dataset. Since our dataset was small (114 occurrences) we expected an important uncertainty associated to data partitioning into calibration and evaluation datasets. We thus performed 350 independent model runs with a training dataset representing a random subset of 80\% of the occurrences and the optimal Maxent parameters. Each model yielded a map of habitat suitability over Niamey, which was transformed into a binary map implementing a threshold maximizing the sensitivity and the specificity. The resulting binary maps were combined to display the proportion of models that indicated a good environmental suitability for Trypanosoma-positive rodents. Maxent performed better with landscape metrics derived from buffers of 80 m. Habitat suitability for Trypanosoma-positive rodents exhibited large patches linked to urban features such as patch richness and the proportion of landscape covered by concrete or tarred areas. Such inferences could be helpful in assessing areas at risk, setting of monitoring programs, public and medical staff awareness or even vaccination campaigns.},

The tempo and mode of evolution of Orthopoxviruses were reconstructed using a Bayesian phylodynamic framework by analysing 80 hemagglutinin sequences retrieved from public databases. Bayesian phylogeography was used to estimate their putative ancestral hosts. In order to estimate the substitution rate, the tree including all of the available Orthopoxviruses was calibrated using historical references dating the South American variola minor clade (alastrim) to between the XVI and XIX century. The mean substitution rate determined by the analysis was 6.5x10-6 substitutions/site/year. Based on this evolutionary estimate, the time of the most recent common ancestor of the genus Orthopoxvirus was placed at about 10 000 years before the present. Cowpox virus was the species closest to the root of the phylogenetic tree. The root of VARV circulating in the XX century was estimated to be about 700 years ago, corresponding to about 1300 AD. The divergence between West African and South American VARV went back about 500 years ago (falling approximately in the XVI century). A rodent species is the most probable ancestral host from which the ancestors of all the known Orthopoxviruses were transmitted to the other mammal host species, and each of these species represented a dead-end for each new poxvirus species, without any further inter-specific spread.},

	abstract = {Context: Zea mays L. (Poacae) husk decoctions are traditionally used in the treatment of malaria by various tribes in Nigeria. Background: To assess the antimalarial and antiplasmodial potentials of the husk extract and fractions on malaria parasites using in vivo and in vitro models. Materials and methods: The ethanol husk extract and fractions (187-748 mg/kg, p.o.) of Zea mays were investigated for antimalarial activity against Plasmodium berghei using rodent (mice) malaria models and in vitro activity against chloroquine sensitive (Pf 3D7) and resistant (Pf INDO) strains of Plasmodium falciparum using the SRBR green assay method. Median lethal dose and cytotoxic activities against HeLa and HEKS cells were also carried out. The GCMS analysis of the most active fraction was carried out. Results: The husk extract (187-748 mg/kg, p.o.) with LD50 of 1874.83 mg/kg was found to exert significant (p{\textless}0.05-0.001) antimalarial activity against P. berghei infection in suppressive, prophylactive and curative tests. The crude extract and fractions also exerted prominent activity against both chloroquine sensitive (Pf 3D7) and resistant (Pf INDO) strains of P. falciparum with the ethyl acetate fraction exerting the highest activity with IC50 values of 9.31+or-0.46 micro g/mL (Pf 3D7) and 3.69+or-0.66 micro g/mL (Pf INDO). The crude extract and fractions were not cytotoxic to the two cell lines tested with IC50 values of {\textgreater}100 micro g/mL against both HeLa and HEKS cell lines. Discussion and conclusion: These results suggest that the husk extract/fractions of Zea mays possesses antimalarial and antiplasmodial activities and these justify its use in ethnomedicine to treat malaria infections.},

Five hundred and eighty eight (588) blood samples were randomly collected from chickens and tested for S. Gallinarum antibodies using Serum plate agglutination test. Direct flock observation, and a short structured questionnaire administered in forty nine (49) flocks was used to collate data on poultry farms, to identify risk factors associated with Salmonella infections in chickens. The overall sero-prevalence established using serum plate agglutination test was 16.7\% (98/588). Using a univariate logistic analysis, factors significantly associated with Salmonella infections at p{\textless}0.05 were presence of other birds in poultry farms (OR=7.2; 95\% CI=1.9334 26.8181), movement of farm attendant from one pen to another (OR=4.5; 95 C.I=1.3034-15.6602), presence of other farm animals and rodents (OR=2.8000 0.6649-11.7915). Effective equipment washing and disinfection and the use of foot bath with disinfectant when entering poultry house significantly reduced the risk of testing positive for Salmonella in chickens (p{\textless}0.05). In conclusion, this study established the seroprevalence and identified risk factors associated with S. Gallinarum infections in chickens in three major towns of Benue State. Therefore, to prevent Salmonella infections in commercial chickens, proper implementation of biosecurity measures, hygiene practices and rodents control in poultry farms are recommended.},

	abstract = {Wesselsbron disease is a neglected mosquito transmitted Flavivirus infection that causes abortions and has teratogenic effects on sheep and cattle in Africa. Human can also be infected. The detection of human or animal cases is complicated by the non-specific symptoms close to Rift Valley Fever (RVF) in domestic livestock species or Dengue like syndrome in humans. Then, these detections are usually made during RVF investigations in sheep. These domestic animals should take a role in the life cycle of the virus but some evidences of Wesselsbron virus (WSLV) presence in wild animals suggest that the latter may be involved in the virus maintenance in nature. However, the reservoir status of wild vertebrate in general and rodents particularly for WSLV is only based on an isolation from a Cape short-eared gerbil in southern Africa. Most of WSLV isolations are from southern parts of Africa even if it has been found in western and central Africa or Madagascar. In Senegal, there are serological evidences of WSLV circulation in human since the 1970s and some isolations, the last one of which dates back in 1992. Despite the detection of the virus on mosquitoes until the 2000s in different parts of the country, no new human case has been noted. In this paper, we report the WSLV re-emergence in eastern Senegal in 2013 with 2 human cases and its first isolation from a black rat Rattus rattus. Sequencing analyses show the circulation of the same strain between these humans and the commensal rodent. The putative impact on WSLV transmission to human populations could be more important if the reservoir status of the black rat is confirmed. Focused survey in human populations, specific entomological and mammalogical investigations would permit a better understanding of the life cycle of the virus and its impact on public health.},

Three lineage 1 viruses belonged to a novel genus of picornaviruses and was more closely related to Hepatovirus than to others genera of picornaviruses based on aa homology. Lineage 2, lineage 3, and lineage 4 viruses belonged to the genera Rosavirus, Hunnivirus, and Enterovirus, respectively, representing new species. According to both phylogenetic and identity analyses, Lineage 2 viruses had a close relationship with rosavirus 2 which was recovered from the feces of a child in Gambia and Lineage 3 viruses had a close relationship with domestic animal Hunnivirus.

Renewed attention to comprehensive survey and inventory to establish the structure of biodiverse faunas is essential in providing indicators and proxies for identifying the outcomes of accelerating change linked to climate warming and anthropogenic forcing. Subsequent to the description of Hymenolepis folkertsi in the oldfield mouse, Peromyscus polionotus, additional specimens of hymenolepidids were collected or discovered in archived museum repositories from multiple species of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus, Peromyscus leucopus), the golden mouse (Ochrotomys nuttalli), chipmunks (Tamias striatus, Tamias amoenus), the 13-lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus), and tree squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis, Sciurus niger) from disjunct localities in the USA spanning southern Georgia, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Wisconsin, and central Idaho. Specimens were largely consistent morphologically with the original description of H. folkertsi. Initial DNA sequence data, from a portion of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1, demonstrated intraspecific variation among three apparently geographically isolated populations attributed to H. folkertsi (uncorrected genetic distances of 2.7\% (Idaho and Michigan), 2.4\% (Virginia+Pennsylvania and Michigan), and 1.89\% (VA+PA and ID)). Geography rather than host association explains the distribution and occurrence of H. folkertsi, and host colonization among deer mice, chipmunks, and other sciurids within regional sites is indicated. Genetic divergence revealed across localities for H. folkertsi suggests historically isolated populations, consistent with extended evolutionary and biogeographic trajectories among hymenolepidids and species of Peromyscus and Tamias in North America. Field inventory, that revealed these parasite populations, substantially alters our understanding of the distribution of diversity and provides insights about the nature of the complex relationships that serve to determine cestode faunas in rodents.},

However, their interaction with viruses or role in arbovirus transmission during epidemics has been little examined, with the exception of O'nyong-nyong virus, closely related to Chikungunya virus. Deep-sequencing has revealed different RNA viruses in natural insect viromes, but none have been previously described in the Anopheles gambiae species complex. Here, we describe two novel insect RNA viruses, a Dicistrovirus and a Cypovirus, found in laboratory colonies of An. gambiae taxa using small-RNA deep sequencing. Sequence analysis was done with Metavisitor, an open-source bioinformatic pipeline for virus discovery and de novo genome assembly. Wild-collected Anopheles from Senegal and Cambodia were positive for the Dicistrovirus and Cypovirus, displaying high sequence identity to the laboratory-derived virus. Thus, the Dicistrovirus (Anopheles C virus, AnCV) and Cypovirus (Anopheles Cypovirus, AnCPV) are components of the natural virome of at least some anopheline species. Their possible influence on mosquito immunity or transmission of other pathogens is unknown. These natural viruses could be developed as models for the study of Anopheles-RNA virus interactions in low security laboratory settings, in an analogous manner to the use of rodent malaria parasites for studies of mosquito anti-parasite immunity.},

There are currently no FDA-licensed therapeutics or vaccines available to combat arenavirus infection. A hallmark of arenavirus infection (e.g., LASV) is general immunosuppression that contributes to high viremia. Here, we discuss the early host immune responses to arenavirus infection and the recently discovered molecular mechanisms that enable pathogenic viruses to suppress host immune recognition and to contribute to the high degree of virulence. We also directly compare the innate immune evasion mechanisms between arenaviruses and other hemorrhagic fever-causing viruses, such as Ebola, Marburg, Dengue, and hantaviruses.

As part of a global metagenomic analysis of viral communities existing in biting midges, we report here for the first time the identification and isolation of a Faustovirus-like virus in hematophagous arthropods and its detection in their animal hosts. The DNA virome analysis of three pools of Culicoides sp., engorged female Culicoides imicola and non-engorged male/female C. imicola biting midges collected in Senegal, revealed the presence of amoeba-infecting giant viruses and, among them, a majority of sequences related to Faustovirus. Phylogenetic analyses conducted on several structural genes of Faustovirus confirmed the clustering of the arthropod-borne Faustovirus with sewage-borne Faustoviruses, with a distinct geographical clustering of Senegalese Faustovirus strains. Transmission electron microscopy identified viral particles with morphologies and diameters which were compatible with Faustovirus. The presence of infectious arthropod-borne Faustovirus was finally confirmed by successful isolation on V. vermiformis amoeba. Global proteomic analysis of biting midges identified that arthropods' blood meal originating from cattle, rodents and humans. Further screening of cattle sera and rodent tissue resulted in prevalence of Faustovirus being estimated at 38\% in rodents and 14\% in cattle, suggesting a possible origin of Faustovirus presence in arthropods via the ingestion of contaminated blood meal. Viral loads were the highest in rodents' urine and kidney samples, suggesting a possible excretion of viral particles into the environment. Faustovirus DNA polymerase-related sequences were also detected in more than 9 and 11\% of febrile patients and healthy Senegalese human sera, respectively. Our study thus, highlights the need to investigate the role of arthropods, wildlife, and domestic animals in the lifecycle of amoeba-infecting giant viruses and, in particular, the environmental cycle of Faustovirus.},

	abstract = {During the post-harvest period, spice crops are subject to losses due to a variety of causes - chemical changes, insect damage, rodent attack, and growth of microorganisms. It therefore becomes imperative to examine the perishability and postharvest management of spices (indigenous and exotic) in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. A well-structured questionnaire was used to gather information from fifty (50) randomly selected farmers in Lagelu local government area of Ibadan, Oyo State. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and regression analysis. The study revealed that more men (90\%) than women were involved in spices production and 50\% were in the age group "41-60 yrs" while 62\% had an average household size of 6-10 people. Sixty-two percent of the farmers stored their spices in baskets, 34\% used bags and 4\% spread out their spices in the open space. The drying method mostly used was sun drying (90\%), 8\% air dried their produce and 2\% oven dried. On the average, 48.67\% of the spices were non-perishable, 19.78\% were mildly perishable and 31.56\% formed the highly perishable spices. The regression results revealed household size, initial capital outlay and location of farm as socio-economic variables affecting income generated on spice production. It is therefore worthy of note that the farmers perspective of spices in the study area is that they are mostly non-perishable.},

Table 2 displays the noticeable evidence of cockroaches and rodents' infestation at homes which revealed that about 40\% of the household answered the evidence of 'rat runs' noticed in rooms while 30\% are of sighting of live cockroaches as evidence. Local rodenticides and insecticides (Snipper, otapiapia, Kill \& Dry, etc) were perceived to be more effective and cheaper as control measures compare to foreign ones.

	abstract = {Background: Croton membranaceus is a plant cherished by traditional healers in Ghana for its anti-prostate cancer properties. Its cytotoxic effect as well as safety has been proved. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted to assess its genotoxic and cytotoxic potential using the rodent bone marrow and colony formation assays respectively. Aims: This study is aimed at investigating the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of the aqueous root extract of Croton membranaceus (CMARE) using the colony formation and rodent bone marrow assays respectively. Study Design: This was an experimental study. Methodology: To determine the cytotoxic effect, BPH-1 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1.0x105 cells/well in 2 mL culture medium (plus 10\% FBS) and incubated for 24 h. After treatment with 0, 1, 3 and 5 mg/ml of CMARE for 48 h, the cells were collected and further treated with fresh medium in the absence of CMARE, and reseeded into new 6-well plates at a density of 1.0x103 cells/well. After 10 days incubation, colonies were fixed in 10\% formalin, crystal violet-stained and counted. Genotoxicity was determined by the bone marrow assay using 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats divided equally into three groups. Animals in the treatment, positive and negative control groups were administered 3000 mg/kg CMARE, N-nitroso-N-methylurea and saline respectively. Results: Cytotoxicity significantly occurred at 3 and 5 mg/ml, compared to the control. The bone marrow assay showed a significant difference between CMARE-treated animals and negative controls when the polychromatic erythrocyte-normochromatic erythrocyte (PCE-NCE) ratios were compared. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between CMARE-treated animals and positive controls when their micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCE) were compared, indicating similar genotoxic potential between very high CMARE doses and the positive control. Conclusion: These results show that CMARE has both cytotoxic and genotoxic potential.},

The present study utilized a rodent model of neuropathy to determine whether an ethanolic leaf extract of Palisota hirsuta (PHE), a plant widely used in West African traditional medicine for pain management and CNS disorders, could attenuate vincristine-induced neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain was induced by injecting rats intraperitoneallywith vincristine (0.1 mg kg-1 day-1 in two 5-day cycles with a two-day break). Randall-Selitto Paw Pressure, Hargreaves, cold water (4-5 degrees C) and Von Frey Filaments tests were performed. These tests were used to assess the degree of mechanical hyperalgesia, thermal hyperalgesia and cold and tactile allodynia respectively as an index of peripheral and central pain sensation.Oral administrations of PHE (30-300 mg kg-1) significantly and dose-dependently ameliorated vincristine-induced pain-related behaviors. It significantly reduced both mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia and completely reversed vincristine-induced tactile allodynia at 100 and 300 mg kg-1 after 24 h. It however showed little effect on cold allodynia. These effects were similar to that of the gabapentin-treated group. In conclusion, oral administration of an ethanolic leaf extract of Palisota hirsuta attenuates pain-related behavior in vincristine-induced neuropathic pain model.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential role of small mammals in the transmission of anthropozoonosis. Methodology and Results: A total of 1,402 domestic small mammals were captured in 54 stations using methods following Houemenou (2006). The most abundant small mammals were, Rattus rattus (black rat) (63.7\%), Mastomys sp. (multimammate rat) (11.84\%), Rattus norvegicus (brown rat) (11.48\%) and Crocidura olivieri (7.85\%). Among these rodents, 364 individuals were found with ectoparasites, and 886 fleas were collected (flea index 0.63), the most common flea being Xenopsylla cheopis (rat flea) (97.2\%). This species was found in all areas of the city and infested all small mammal species. The Pulicidae prevalence (26\%) showed important variations, with relatively low and significantly higher prevalence during the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. Conclusions and application of findings: Small mammal community in Cotonou was dominated by Rattus rattus and fleas by Xenopsylla cheopis. Due to the presence of a seaport of paramount importance, Cotonou town was not away from importation by sea transport of zoonotic rats (shelter ships calling at the port of Cotonou, from all continents). To date, in Cotonou there is lacking information on pathogenic agents hosted by the small mammals and their ectoparasites. Therefore, awareness of the authorities on the zoonotic risk of small mammals for the human population is necessary. The authorities of the Port Autonome de Cotonou must increase the screening of ships, which arrive at Cotonou to avoid zoonotic rodent importation. The Ministry of Human Health in Benin must sensitize the populations at high risk of the rodent transmitted diseases. Further studies are needed to detect the different animal reservoirs of these pathogenic agents.},

	abstract = {The presence of bartonellae in invasive rats (Rattus rattus) and indigenous rodents (Arvicanthis niloticus and Cricetomys gambianus) from two districts in Uganda, Arua and Zombo, was examined by PCR detection and culture. Blood from a total of 228 R. rattus, 31 A. niloticus, and 5 C. gambianus was screened using genus-specific primers targeting the 16 S-23 S intergenic spacer region. Furthermore, rodent blood was plated on brain heart infusion blood agar, and isolates were verified as Bartonella species using citrate synthase gene- (gltA) specific primers. One hundred and four fleas recovered from R. rattus were also tested for the presence of Bartonella species using the same gltA primer set. An overall prevalence of 1.3\% (three of 228) was obtained in R. rattus, whereas 61.3\% of 31 A. niloticus and 60\% of five C. gambianus were positive for the presence of Bartonella species. Genotypes related to Bartonella elizabethae, a known zoonotic pathogen, were detected in three R. rattus and one C. gambianus. Bartonella strains, similar to bacteria detected in indigenous rodents from other African countries, were isolated from the blood of A. niloticus. Bartonellae, similar to bacteria initially cultured from Ornithodorus sonrai (soft tick) from Senegal, were found in two C. gambianus. Interestingly, bartonellae detected in fleas from invasive rats were similar to bacteria identified in indigenous rodents and not their rat hosts, with an overall prevalence of 6.7\%. These results suggest that if fleas are competent vectors of these bartonellae, humans residing in these two districts of Uganda are potentially at greater risk for exposure to Bartonella species from native rodents than from invasive rats. The low prevalence of bartonellae in R. rattus was quite surprising, in contrast, to the detection of these organisms in a large percentage of Rattus species from other geographical areas. A possible reason for this disparity is discussed.},

In this report, we present the complete genome analysis of a newfound hantavirus, designated Bowe virus, detected in ethanol-fixed intercostal muscle of a Doucet's musk shrew (Crocidura douceti), captured in southwestern Guinea in February 2012. Full-length amino acid sequence comparison of the S-, M- and L-segment gene products revealed that Bowe virus differed by 24.1-53.4\%, 17.0-59.9\% and 14.6-39.7\%, respectively, from all other representative rodent-, shrew- and mole-borne hantaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis, using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods, under the GTR+I+ model of evolution, showed that Bowe virus shared a common ancestry with Tanganya virus, a hantavirus detected in the Therese's shrew (Crocidura theresae) in Guinea. Whole genome analysis of many more hantaviruses from sub-Saharan Africa are needed to better clarify how the radiation of African shrews might have contributed to the phylogeography of hantaviruses.},

	abstract = {A serological survey of Toxoplasma gondii was conducted on 766 domestic and peridomestic rodents from 46 trapping sites throughout the city of Niamey, Niger. A low seroprevalence was found over the whole town with only 1.96\% of the rodents found seropositive. However, differences between species were important, ranging from less than 2\% in truly commensal Mastomys natalensis, Rattus rattus and Mus musculus, while garden-associated Arvicanthis niloticus displayed 9.1\% of seropositive individuals. This is in line with previous studies on tropical rodents - that we reviewed here - which altogether show that Toxoplasma seroprevalence in rodent is highly variable, depending on many factors such as locality and/or species. Moreover, although we were not able to decipher statistically between habitat or species effect, such a contrast between Nile grass rats and the other rodent species points towards a potentially important role of environmental toxoplasmic infection. This would deserve to be further scrutinised since intra-city irrigated cultures are extending in Niamey, thus potentially increasing Toxoplasma circulation in this yet semi-arid region. As far as we are aware of, our study is one of the rare surveys of its kind performed in Sub-Saharan Africa and the first one ever conducted in the Sahel.},

	abstract = {Background: Bartonellae are fastidious bacteria causing persistent bacteremia in humans and a wide variety of animals. In recent years there is an increasing interest in mammalian bartonelloses in general and in rodent bartonelloses in particular. To date, no studies investigating the presence of Bartonella spp. in rodents and ectoparasites from Nigeria were carried out. Methodology/Principal Findings: The aim of the current study was to investigate the presence of Bartonella spp. in commensal rodents and their ectoparasites in Nigeria. We report, for the first time, the molecular detection of Bartonella in 26\% (46/177) of commensal rodents (Rattus rattus, R. norvegicus and Cricetomys gambianus) and 28\% (9/32) of ectoparasite pools (Xenopsylla cheopis, Haemolaelaps spp., Ctenophthalmus spp., Hemimerus talpoides, and Rhipicephalus sanguineus) from Nigeria. Sequence analysis of the citrate synthase gene (gltA) revealed diversity of Bartonella spp. and genotypes in Nigerian rodents and their ectoparasites. Bartonella spp. identical or closely related to Bartonella elizabethae, Bartonella tribocorum and Bartonella grahamii were detected. Conclusions/Significance: High prevalence of infection with Bartonella spp. was detected in commensal rodents and ectoparasites from Nigeria. The Bartonella spp. identified were previously associated with human diseases highlighting their importance to public health. Further studies need to be conducted to determine whether the identified Bartonella species could be responsible for human cases of febrile illness in Nigeria.},

(Caesalpiniaceae), a plant used locally in Ghana for treating pain associated with ulcer and menstruation, was evaluated in various rodent models. Method: The anti-inflammatory property was assessed using carrageenan-induced rat paw edema test while the anti-nociceptive effect was evaluated in the formalin, mechanical hyperalgesia, hot plate and acetic acid writhing tests. The possible involvement of the opioid, muscarinic cholinergic, adenosinergic, NO-cGMP and ATP-sensitive K+ channels receptor systems in the anti-nociceptive effect of C. sieberiana extract (CS-Ea) was also studied in the acetic acid writhing test. Results: Results indicate that CS-Ea possesses significant (p{\textless}0.05) anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects in all the test models used. Systemic administration of naloxone, atropine and theophylline significantly blocked the anti-nociceptive effect of the extract. However, systemic N-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and glibenclamide did not effects the effects of the extract significantly (p{\textgreater}0.05). Conclusion: These results show that CS-Ea has anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities. The anti-nociceptive effects might be partly attributed to interactions with the opioidergic, muscarinic cholinergic and adenosinergic systems.},

	abstract = {Background: Lassa hemorrhagic fever (LHF) is a rodent-borne viral disease that can be fatal for human beings. In this study, an attenuated Lassa vaccine candidate, ML29, was tested in SIV-infected rhesus macaques for its ability to elicit immune responses without instigating signs pathognomonic for arenavirus disease. ML29 is a reassortant between Lassa and Mopeia viruses that causes a transient infection in non-human primates and confers sterilizing protection from lethal Lassa viral challenge. However, since the LHF endemic area of West Africa also has high HIV seroprevalence, it is important to determine whether vaccination could be safe in the context of HIV infection. Results: SIV-infected and uninfected rhesus macaques were vaccinated with the ML29 virus and monitored for specific humoral and cellular immune responses, as well as for classical and non-classical signs of arenavirus disease. Classical disease signs included viremia, rash, respiratory distress, malaise, high liver enzyme levels, and virus invasion of the central nervous system. Non-classical signs, derived from profiling the blood transcriptome of virulent and non-virulent arenavirus infections, included increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) and decreased expression of COX2, IL-1beta, coagulation intermediates and nuclear receptors needed for stress signaling. All vaccinated monkeys showed ML29-specific antibody responses and ML29-specific cell-mediated immunity. Conclusion: SIV-infected and uninfected rhesus macaques responded similarly to ML29 vaccination, and none developed chronic arenavirus infection. Importantly, none of the macaques developed signs, classical or non-classical, of arenavirus disease.},

	abstract = {African swine fever (ASF) is an economically devastating disease for the pig industry, especially in Africa. Identifying what supports infection on pig farms in this region remains the key component in developing a risk-based approach to understanding the epidemiology of ASF and controlling the disease. Nigeria was used for this matched case-control study, because there is perpetual infection in some areas, while contiguous areas are intermittently infected. Risk factors and biosecurity practices in pig farms were evaluated in association with ASF infection. Subsets of farms located in high-density pig population areas and high-risk areas for ASF infection were randomly selected for analysis. Most plausible risk factor variables from the univariable analysis included in the multivariable analysis include: owner of farm had regular contact with infected farms and other farmers, untested pigs were routinely purchased into the farm in the course of outbreaks, there was an infected neighbourhood, other livestock were kept alongside pigs, there was a presence of an abattoir/slaughter slab in pig communities, wild birds had free access to pig pens, tools and implements were routinely shared by pig farmers, there was free access to feed stores by rats, and feed was purchased from a commercial source. Only the presence of an abattoir in a pig farming community (OR=8.20; CI95\%=2.73, 24.63; P{\textless}0.001) and the presence of an infected pig farm in the neighbourhood (OR=3.26; CI95\%=1.20, 8.83; P=0.02) were significant. There was a marginally significant negative association (protective) between risk of ASF infection and sharing farm tools and equipment (OR=0.35; CI95\%=0.12, 1.01; P=0.05). Of the 28 biosecurity measures evaluated, food and water control (OR=0.14; CI95\%=0.04, 0.46; P{\textless}0.001), separation/isolation of sick pigs (OR=0.14; CI95\%=0.04, 0.53; P=0.004) and washing and disinfection of farm equipment and tools (OR=0.27; CI95\%=0.10, 0.78; P=0.02) were negatively associated (protective) with ASF infection. Consultation and visits by veterinarian/paraveterinarians when animals were sick (OR=8.11; CI95\%=2.13, 30.90; P=0.002), and pest and rodent control were positively associated with ASF infection of Nigerian farms (OR=4.94; CI95\%=1.84, 13.29; P=0.002). The presentation of sick and unthrifty pigs for slaughter at abattoirs, farmers' inadvertent role, an infected neighbourhood, a pig to pig contact, rodents and wild birds may contribute to infections of farms, whereas washing, disinfection of tools, food and water control, and separation of sick pigs reduces the likelihood of infections. Underlying reasons for these observations and strategies for control are discussed.},

Blood smears originating from rodents and shrews from the three countries indicated the presence of Trypanosoma lewisi (72.7\%; n=950), Bacillus spp. (25.6\%; n=950), Borrelia sp. (0.01\%; n=950) and bipolar coccobacilli (0.01\%; n=950). The blood smears from Namibia (n=26) had no haemoparasites while only 1.33\% (n=75) of those from Swaziland showed presence of T. lewisi. Leptospira interrogans was found in rodent blood sera from Tanzania in the following serogroup proportions (n=350): Icterohaemorrhagiae (10.29\%), Pomona (2.86\%), Hardjo (1.14\%), Bullum (0.86\%), Grippotyphosa (1.43\%) and Canicola (1.14\%). Serodiagnosis of antibodies against the F1 antigen of Y. pestis using the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was negative for all the serum samples from central Tanzania, while two samples of serum from two species of rodents, Rhabdomys pumilio and Gerbilliscus leucogaster, collected in the Kavango Region of Namibia were positive. These results suggest an enzootic plague activity in this region in Namibia. It is concluded that zoonotic agents, that are infectious to humans, are prevalent in rodents and shrews in the three countries, and that local communities should apply rodent control measures to reduce the risk of human infections.},

	abstract = {Fumonisin B1 (FB1) is often a co-contaminant with aflatoxin (AF) in grains and may enhance AF's carcinogenicity by acting as a cancer promoter. Calcium montmorillonite (i.e. NovaSil, NS) is a possible dietary intervention to help decrease chronic aflatoxin exposure where populations are at risk. Previous studies show that an oral dose of NS clay was able to reduce AF exposure in a Ghanaian population. In vitro analyses from our laboratory indicated that FB1 (like aflatoxin) could also be sorbed onto the surfaces of NS. Hence, our objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of NS clay to reduce urinary FB1 in a rodent model and then in a human population highly exposed to AF. In the rodent model, male Fisher rats were randomly assigned to either FB1 control, FB1+2\% NS or absolute control group. FB1 alone or with clay was given as a single dose by gavage. For the human trial, participants received NS (1.5 or 3 g day-1) or placebo (1.5 g day-1) for 3 months. Urines from weeks 8 and 10 were collected from the study participants for analysis. In rats, NS significantly reduced urinary FB1 biomarker by 20\% in 24 h and 50\% after 48 h compared to controls. In the humans, 56\% of the urine samples analysed (n=186) had detectable levels of FB1. Median urinary FB1 levels were significantly (p{\textless}0.05) decreased by {\textgreater}90\% in the high dose NS group (3 g day-1) compared to the placebo. This work indicates that our study participants in Ghana were exposed to FB1 (in addition to AFs) from the diet. Moreover, earlier studies have shown conclusively that NS reduces the bioavailability of AF and the findings from this study suggest that NS clay also reduces the bioavailability FB1. This is important since AF is a proven dietary risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in humans and FB1 is suspected to be a dietary risk factor for HCC and oesophageal cancer in humans.},

Material and Method: Data were sourced from the archives of casualties of zinc phosphide poisoning. These were entered into a generated case data form after obtaining an ethical permission. Results: All the ages of the 23 casualties reported were within 37.74+or-13.20 years. The male-female ratio was 4.75:1. Nineteen [78.26\%] died after reporting 13.52+or-11.34 hours following single ingestion. Twenty cases were due to suicidal tendencies; the most common reason given was because of frustration in life related to marital affairs. Among the three unintentional, two were accidental while the other was due to assassination. Postmortem was refused in all the patients that died. One attempted herbal medication. Oil and milk were the most frequent solvents used at home as first-aid care therapy. Three were unintentional. Nine came with empty sachets and containers brought by relatives. Sodium chloride intravenous infusion was the most frequently used. Duration of hospitalization was 13.38+or-15.60 hours. Intravenous ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were the most common antibiotics used. Oxygen was instituted in 78.26\% of the victims during respiratory distress. One ate meal prepared from poisoned rodent and died after reporting. One had alcohol along with the Zinc Phosphide ingestion. Nine were reported at the drug and poison information centre. Conclusion: Attention is needed by all for proper regulation in the handling of poisons and related substances to reduce burden minimally.},

Furthermore, the blood of the exposed mice had dose-dependent hypochromasia, macrocytosis, microcytosis, eosinophilia and arisocytosis. A significant difference (p{\textless}0.05) also exists between the mean blood parameters of the control mice and the mean blood parameters of the mice exposed to the various concentrations of the detergent.

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to carry out basic ecological research on rodent pests within subsistence-level agricultural communities in Africa. A range of techniques were used to collect baseline ecological knowledge on the temporal and spatial dynamics of rodent populations within rural farming communities in Tanzania, Swaziland and Namibia. These techniques included habitat surveys using removal trapping, capture-mark-recapture grids, and radio tracking of individually tagged animals. We also studied the local communities' knowledge, attitudes and practices with respect to rodents and their control, the current cost of rodent damage and the costs/benefits of rodent control. Based on these data, a case-control trial was implemented to evaluate an ecologically-based rodent management (EBRM) intervention using intensive trapping coordinated at the community level. Results showed that intensive trapping using community based rodent management was cost-beneficial for rural farming communities, and these EBRM strategies are ecologically sustainable. Our research has shown that efficacy is more than 75\% when compared to what farmers normally do to reduce rat populations. Farmer training and community cooperation are essential, and expertise in social anthropology to develop appropriate knowledge dissemination platforms must be supported.},

The over all objective of the study was to identify the processing preservation, packaging methods, distribution channels and marketing of cured fish in the study areas, so as ascertain its shelf stability and economic benefits. A total of 103 processors randomly selected were interviewed during the survey. The data obtained were analyzed by descriptive statistics and results obtained revealed that majority of the processors were married women who were not educated beyond secondary school level. Smoking was the main curing method and storage materials for cured fish were baskets, jute bags and plastic drums. Causes of loss on cured fish include insect infestation, rodent attacks, mould attacks and breakage due to packing. Packaging and storage methods improve the shelf life of the cured products and packaging materials includes the use of jute bags, paper bags, baskets and these were stored on top of smoke houses and in kitchens. Land transportation was the major means of distribution using wheel barrows, vehicles and trucks. Processing activities within the study area was found to be lucrative but are constrained by high cost of transportation, processing and labour. Thus, the economics and living standard in processing area was quite low. It is recommended that Government should engage in the rehabilitation of the access routes leading to the processing communities, so as to improve transportation system and facilitate mobility of cured fish. Government via its appropriate agencies should sensitize the processors and transporters against over loading of cured fish so as to limit economic losses due to fragmentation on the curer.},

	abstract = {Evidence of emerging Plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemisinin-based combination therapies, documented in western Cambodia, underscores the continuing need to identify new antimalarial combinations. Given recent reports of the resurgence of chloroquine-sensitive P. falciparum parasites in Malawi, after the enforced and prolonged withdrawal of this drug, and indications of a possible synergistic interaction with the macrolide azithromycin, we sought to further characterize chloroquine-azithromycin combinations for their in vitro and in vivo antimalarial properties. In vitro 96-h susceptibility testing of chloroquine-azithromycin combinations showed mostly additive interactions against freshly cultured P. falciparum field isolates obtained from Mali. Some evidence of synergy, however, was apparent at the fractional 90\% inhibitory concentration level. Additional in vitro testing highlighted the resistance reversal properties of amlodipine for both chloroquine and quinine. In vivo experiments, using the Peters 4-day suppressive test in a P. yoelii mouse model, revealed up to 99.9\% suppression of parasitemia following treatment with chloroquine-azithromycin plus the R enantiomer of amlodipine. This enantiomer was chosen because it does not manifest the cardiac toxicities observed with the racemic mixture. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses in this rodent model and subsequent extrapolation to a 65-kg adult led to the estimation that 1.8 g daily of R-amlodipine would be required to achieve similar efficacy in humans, for whom this is likely an unsafe dose. While these data discount amlodipine as an additional partner for chloroquine-based combination therapy, our studies continue to support azithromycin as a safe and effective addition to antimalarial combination therapies.},

	abstract = {Household food security exists when members at all times have physical and economic access to adequate, safe, acceptable and nutritious foods to meet their daily requirements and food preferences for an active and healthy life. Preservation of post-harvest surpluses makes local staples available and affordable during off season. In Nigeria, food insecurity at the household level can partly be attributed to poor preservation of post-harvest surpluses. This study sought to demonstrate a relationship (if any) between preservation of post harvest surpluses and food security at rural household level. Eha-Alumona and Opi-Uno, in Nsukka, Enugu State were the two rural communities selected because they have farming as their major occupation. Interviews and questionnaires were used to elicit information on socio-economic characteristics, foods preserved and methods, problems encountered and effect of preservation on food security of two hundred households. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics and results presented as frequencies and percentages. About 42\% of households partly produced and partly purchased foods, while 17\% depended solely on family food production. Most households (90\%) preserved foods mainly by sun-drying cereal, legumes, vegetables and roots/tubers. All the households (100\%) stored palm oil in bottles or jars while 87.5\% smoked meat/fish. Sun-dried foods were perceived wholesome until used by 61.5\% households. About 62\% households consumed their preserved foods, 19\% sold, while 19.4\% consumed part and sold part. Sixty-four percent (64\%) were food-secure which they attributed to preservation of post-harvest surpluses. However, 36\% did not have enough because of spoilage and rodent/insect attack. Hunger at rural household level can be reduced if post harvest surpluses are properly preserved. The Nigerian local government should encourage community food preservation through cooperative societies, provision of necessary infrastructure, funding and education.},

The abundance and diversity of small mammal communities were investigated in human-influenced savannahs in close proximity to Niokolo Koba National Park (NKNP) in south-eastern Senegal and compared with those from NKNP. Two localities were sampled in natural and two in human-influenced areas during two dry and two rainy seasons. Total sampling effort was 5400 trap-nights. Ninety-eight individuals of eleven species were captured outside NKNP, while only 28 individuals of five rodent species were caught inside the park (all of which were found also outside NKNP). The most abundant species outside NKNP was Mastomys erythroleucus, while inside NKNP it was Praomys daltoni. Both relative abundance and diversity were significantly higher in human-influenced landscape than in natural savannahs of NKNP. The difference in species richness may be linked with lower population densities of certain species in NKNP and the effect of traditional agriculture, which may support the presence of species typical for deforested landscape. Furthermore, food availability, and predator abundances are discussed as possible reasons for the higher rodent abundances outside NKNP.},

The most frequent medical complaints among the respondents in the rural settlements were those of severe headache, backache and febrile illness with permanent or temporary hearing defects. The urban respondents reported more of sore throat, cough and epigastric pain. More rural respondents hunt for and eat rodent meat and leave their foodstuff open when compared to the same habits among urban respondents. Respondents from both communities reported higher rodent activities at night and during the dry season. A high prevalence of CF antibodies against LFV was detected among the rodent sera tested. Thirty six (55\%) out of the 65 positive sera had high titers ranging from 1:32 to 1:256.

We conducted studies in Senegal to better understand the relationship between DC subset activation and susceptibility of pregnant women to malaria. For each woman, samples were collected at delivery from peripheral (WB), placental (PB) and cord blood (CB). The ex vivo phenotypes of DCs were assessed using flow cytometry on whole blood. The percentage of total DCs was the same for malaria-infected or non-infected pregnant women, except for PB where a decrease in DCs was observed during infection. Lymphoid dendritic cells (LDC) also decreased in the three blood compartments of infected pregnant women and less differentiated DCs (ldDCs) increased. During infection, Human Leucocyte Antigen DR (HLA-DR) expression decreased on LDCs, myeloid DCs (MDCs) and ldDCs. IL-10 increased in the three blood compartments. These data demonstrate a modulation of DC sub-populations during placental malaria. A decrease in LDCs during placental malaria could trigger major alterations in the immune response and a change in the Th1/Th2 balance. However, elevated IL-10 observed during infection substantiates a normal micro-environment triggering normal production of DCs. The decrease in LDCs could thus be due to their migration towards spleen or other lymphoid organs.},

	abstract = {Cost-effective interventions that reduce human diseases and death from aflatoxin exposure are high priorities particularly for developing nations. A calcium montmorillonite clay, NovaSilTM, when mixed at low inclusion rates with animal feeds can act as a selective enterosorbent for aflatoxins. NovaSilTM sequesters aflatoxins in the gastrointestinal tract and neutralizes their toxic effects by reducing the bioavailability of the toxins in the blood and other organs. These findings are especially significant for developing countries since clay-based strategies for managing aflatoxicosis would be practical, culturally acceptable, sustainable and unique in reducing external exposure and risk. When included in the diet of animals at levels up to 2.0\% (w/w), NovaSilTM clay did not interfere with vitamin or micronutrient utilization. These results also support the hypothesis that NovaSilTM clay interventions in developing countries could have a major impact on health and well-being of susceptible humans who are highly and frequently exposed to these dietary toxins without compromising their nutritional status. Recent work has confirmed the relative safety of NovaSilTM in a long-term rodent study at and in a Phase I Adverse Events trial. No significant NovaSilTM-related effects were observed in either study, and the conclusions were that NovaSilTM should be tested in a Phase II human trial in Ghana. A study population in Ghana has been identified that is exposed to high levels of dietary aflatoxins based on biomarkers in their blood and urine samples. This study will evaluate the consequences of NovaSilTM treatment on aflatoxin exposure over a 3-month period. In summary, enterosorption strategies, based on dietary NovaSilTM clay, hold great promise for the management of aflatoxins in high-risk human populations especially in developing countries. The remedy is novel, inexpensive and easily disseminated.},

However, available evidences are restricted to rodent models in which Vbeta specific T cell expansion has been associated with neurological syndrome suggesting involvement of superantigens or dominant antigens. Using flow cytometry, we studied the peripheral VbetaT cell repertoire of Ghanaian children with cerebral malaria, uncomplicated malaria and asymptomatic control children, to look for either expansion or deletion of specific Vbeta associated with cerebral malaria. At admission, the general pattern of the repertoire of the patients was very similar, with no major distortion compared to the control group a part a significant increase of the frequency of the Vbeta21.3 subset correlating with disease severity and attributed to the CD4 subset. During convalescence very limited fluctuations were observed including a significant decrease of the Vbeta21.3 subset and increase of the Vbeta20 subset, a subset not detected at admission. The remarkable stability of the Vbeta repertoire observed in acute malaria either cerebral or uncomplicated argues against the idea that cerebral malaria would result from a T cell-mediated inflammatory shock syndrome driven by some dominant super-antigenic activity(ies). The significance of the reproducible increase of the CD4+Vbeta21.3T cell subset deserves further investigations.},

Its leaves and fruits are traditionally used in West Africa for the management of brain disorders. Aim of the study: This study evaluated the effect of Tetrapleura tetraptera methanol fruit extract (TT) on bilateral common carotid artery occlusion-induced cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in male Wistar rats. Materials and methods: Rats pretreated with TT for 7 days before a 30 min bilateral common carotid artery occlusion and reperfusion for 24 h were assessed for neurobehavioural deficits. Cortical, striatal and hippocampal oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory events, electrolyte imbalance and neurochemical dysfunctions, as well as hippocampal histopathological alterations, were also evaluated. HPLC-DAD analysis was performed to identify likely compounds contributing to the bioactivity of the extract. Results: TT reduced I/R-induced behavioral deficits and ameliorated I/R-induced oxidative stress by restoring reduced glutathione level, increasing catalase and superoxide dismutase activities, and also reducing both lipid peroxidation and xanthine oxidase activity in the brain. TT attenuated I/R-increased myeloperoxidase and lactate dehydrogenase activities as well as disturbances in Na+ and K+ levels. Alterations elicited by I/R in the activities of Nat/K+ ATPase, complex I, glutamine synthetase, acetylcholinesterase, and dopamine metabolism were abated by TT pretreatment. TT prevented I/R-induced histological changes in the hippocampus. HPLC-DAD analysis revealed the presence of aridanin, a marker compound for Tetrapleura tetraptera, and other phytochemicals. Conclusions: These findings indicate that Tetrapleura tetraptera fruit has a protective potential against stroke through modulation of redox and electrolyte imbalances, and attenuation of neurotransmitter dysregulation and other neurochemical dysfunctions. Tetrapleura tetraptera fruit could be a promising source for the discovery of bioactives for stroke therapy.},

	abstract = {Simple Summary Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus (LASV). It is a deadly rodent-borne zoonosis with outbreaks occurring mostly in Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Nigeria, in West Africa. In Sierra Leone, surveillance activities of LASV focus mainly on the Kenema area in the eastern region, known to be the epicentre. Little is known about the presence of the virus in the Bo area, where Mastomys natalensis and Rattus rattus share habitats with humans. Our study investigated the circulation and phylogeny of new LASV strains and virus seroprevalence in rodent populations of villages in Bo district. Information provided here will be of great importance in prioritizing areas for Lassa fever surveillance and preventive measures to mitigate future outbreaks. Our rodent longitudinal survey carried out over two years (2014-2016) identified Mastomys natalensis as the most prevalent species. While seropositive small mammals were found in every village, the four Mastomys natalensis rodents that tested PCR-positive for Lassa virus were found in only two villages. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these sequences belong to the Sierra Leonean clade, within lineage IV. In conclusion, LASV is present, with low circulation, in small mammals in rural settings around Bo. Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus LASV, which was first isolated in the rodent Mastomys natalensis in 1974 in Kenema, Sierra Leone. As little is known about the abundance and the presence of LASV in rodents living in the Bo area, we carried out a small mammal longitudinal population survey. A standardized trapping session was performed in various habitats and seasons in six villages over two years (2014-2016) and samples collected were tested for arenavirus IgG and LASV. A Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was performed on sequences identified by PCR. A total of 1490 small mammals were collected, and 16 rodent species were identified, with M. natalensis (355, 24\%) found to be the most prevalent species. Forty-one (2.8\%) samples were IgG positive, and 31 of these were trapped in homes and 10 in surrounding vegetation. Twenty-nine of 41 seropositive rodents were M. natalensis. We detected four LASV by PCR in two villages, all found in M. natalensis. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the sequences were distributed within the Sierra Leonean clade within lineage IV, distinguishing a Bo sub-clade older than a Kenema sub-clade. Compared to other settings, we found a low abundance of M. natalensis and a low circulation of LASV in rodents in villages around Bo district.},

Here, we use Bayesian tip-dating analysis of a 109-character morphological matrix containing 57 living and extinct ctenohystricans to test these proposed placements for Paraphiomys' simonsi. Our analyses provide support for the exclusion of `Paraphiomys' simonsi from both Paraphiomys and Neosciuromys and justify the establishment of a new genus (Monamys gen. nov.) for this stem thryonomyoid. These analyses also indicate that the divergence of the extant dassie rat Petromus from the extant cane rat Thryonomys (i.e. origin of crown Thryonomyoidea) occurred similar to 23.7 Mya, close to the Oligocene-Miocene boundary and in close agreement with recent molecular estimates for this split. Miocene Neosciuromys, Paraulacodus, Protohummus and the type species of Paraphiomys are identified as stem thryonomyids, whereas the Namibian species Apodecter strorneri, Tufamys woodi,Paraphiomys' australis and Paraphionzys' roessneri are identified for the first time as stem petromurids, raising the possibility of a long period of endemic petromurid evolution in south-west Africa. Comparison of molecular divergence estimates with our optimal tip-dated topology suggests that stem bathyergoids are most likely to have arisen from late Eocene and early Oligocene `phiomyids'.},

	abstract = {Mastomys natalensis is widespread in sub-Saharan Africa and hosts several arenavirus species, including the pathogenic zoonotic Lassa virus in West Africa. Mitochondrial lineages sub-divide the range of M. natalensis and have been associated with cryptic structure within the species. To test specificity of arenaviruses to hosts carrying these lineages, we screened 1772 M. natalensis in a large area of Tanzania where three mitochondrial lineages meet. We detected fifty-two individuals that were positive for one of three arenaviruses: Gairo, Morogoro, and Luna virus. This is the first record of Luna virus in Tanzania. We confirmed the specificity of each arenavirus to a distinct host mitochondrial lineage except for three cases in one locality at the centre of a host hybrid zone. No arenaviruses were detected in a large part of the study area. Morogoro and Gairo virus showed differences in prevalence (Morogoro virus lower than Gairo virus) and in genetic structure (Morogoro virus more structured than Gairo virus). However, both viruses have genetic neighbourhood size estimates of the same order of magnitude as Lassa virus. While differences in arenavirus and/or host evolutionary and ecological dynamics may exist, Tanzanian arenaviruses could be suited to model Lassa virus dynamics in M. natalensis.},

Studies on behavioural ecology of wild mammals are particularly challenging in tropical areas, mostly when involving rare or elusive species. Despite being a common species in Italy, the crested porcupine Hystrix cristata is threatened of extinction throughout most of its sub-Saharan range. All available information on the ecology of this species has been collected in Italy, whereas no data is present in the scientific literature on spatiotemporal behaviour of this large rodent in Africa. In this work, we attempted to determine habitat selection and temporal patterns of activity rhythms of the crested porcupine in northern Benin and neighbouring countries, through intensive camera-trapping. We collected a total of 146 records of crested porcupine, 91 in the dry season (October-March) and 55 in the rainy season (April-September). Porcupines used most habitats in proportion to their local availability, while selecting rock outcrop formations (possibly used as shelter sites) and avoiding open areas, wetlands and gallery forests. A mostly nocturnal behaviour was confirmed throughout the year, with some diurnal activity at the start and at the end of the rainy season. The importance of rains in determining birth peak has been also showed, with juvenile individuals always observed at the start and at the end of the rainy season. Full moon always inhibited activity of this large rodent, most likely evolved as an antipredatory behaviour to limit encounters with potential predators (common leopard Panthera pardus, spotted hyaena Crocuta crocuta and honey badger Mellivora capensis) and humans. Poaching pressure towards porcupines in West Africa is strong. Porcupines are killed for the traditional medicine, for their meat and because they are widely considered as a crop pest. This assessment should therefore be used as a basic tool to design conservation plans to preserve this rodent species in its native range.},

The sites were two traditionally protected `sacred groves', two plots in the legally protected Shai Hills Resource Reserve, and two fire-protected sites: secondary forest and a Gmelina tree plantation. A total of 241 individuals representing four species of shrews and nine species of rodents was caught. Abundance, diversity, and composition of small mammals varied greatly between sites. Praomys tullbergi was the most abundant species in the sacred groves, whereas Mastomys erythroleucus dominated in the fire-protected site and in the plantation. The more open grassland areas in the Shai Hills were dominated by Lemniscomys striatus and Uranomys ruddi. Shrews were caught only in forests having dense leaf litter. Legally protected reserve sites had the highest diversity of small mammals but population densities were low. In contrast, the sacred groves had lower diversity levels but much higher population densities, resulting in 1.9 to 14.6 times the biomass of any of the other sites. The rodents Mus minutoides and Hylomyscus alleni and the shrews Crocidura buettikoferi and C. lamottei were found only in the sacred groves. Sacred groves play an important socio-cultural role. Their local ecological and economic importance as reservoirs for rare and useful plants is well known. This study shows that they are also important refuges for certain small mammal species and support characteristic mammal communities. An attempt to measure the impact of the invading exotic tree Azadirachta indica (neem tree) on small mammals was inconclusive, although trapping success was low in areas with dense stands of neem.},

However, the association of biodiversity with the geographical expansion of LF has not been the subject of epidemiological studies., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a spatial analysis based on sociodemographic, geographical, and ecological data, and found that higher rodent species richness was significantly associated with a lower risk of LF emergence in West Africa from 2008 to 2017 (Odds Ratio = 0.852, 95\% Credible Interval = 0.745-0.971)., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results reinforce the importance of the 'One Health' approach by demonstrating that a high level of biodiversity could benefit human health.},

The object of the present study has been, first, to record cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis having occurred in private and public health centres in Ouagadougou from 1996 to 1998 and, second, to determine the progression of the disease in space and time. We wished also to confirm clinical cases in 1998 by parasitological examination, identify different clinical forms of the disease and map out cases in the town. We carried out a retrospective study from 1996 to 1998 and a prospective study in 1998. All cases recorded in this period in visited health centres were included. A total of 1845 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis was identified, 50.3\% of whom concerned women. The age of patients varied between 1 and 79 years for 356 patients, with a mean age of 26.7 years. Cases increased between 1996 and 1998 (1996 = 61 cases, 1997 = 552 cases, 1998 = 1218 cases). The months of highest incidence were August (13\%), September (15\%) and October (17\%). Peripheral districts (28, 30, 29, 16, 15) in south-eastern areas of the town were the worst touched with 87\% of cases. On average, patients seek care after 2 months of progression of the disease. The ulcero-crusted form (68.2\%) was the most frequent clinical form observed for 327 patients, but almost half of the cases had more than one site of infection, (43.5\%). Over half of the patients presented fewer than 10 lesions with an average of 6. The most common locations were on uncovered parts of the body, notably the superior (53\%) and inferior limbs (49\%). The parasite could be tested for by smear on 52 patients only in 1998 and 53.8\% of cases tested were positive. Leishmania major, which is very prevalent in West Africa was identified in one patient. The vectors and main reservoirs of the parasite were not studied. Case management was generally incomplete; the most commonly prescribed drugs were antibiotics (70\% of patients), but self-medication was frequent. Our recommendations after this preliminary study are: undertake multidisciplinary studies on cutaneous leishmaniasis in Ouagadougou in order to understand the local aetiology (vectors responsible for transmission, rodent and domestic animals involved in the epidemiological chain, parasite species); identify all other areas in the country where the disease is highly prevalent provide health care staff with a decisional algorithm and protocol therapy carry out and active control programme for cutaneous leishmaniasis in Burkina Faso.},

	abstract = {We report on the results of a small mammal survey in the Atewa Range Forest Reserve. A total of 12 bat species were recorded. Composition of bat species clearly reﬂects a forest assemblage, with no savanna species being observed. Two rarely recorded bat species (Hypsugo [crassulus] bellieri and Pipistrellus aﬀ. grandidieri) are reported for the ﬁrst time for Ghana, raising the total number of species for this country to 86. Together with specimens from ﬁve localities in West Africa, Pipistrellus aﬀ. grandidieri from Atewa might represent an undescribed species. Hypsugo (crassulus) bellieri is endemic to the Upper Guinean forests. Zenker’s fruit bat Scotonycteris zenkeri is ranked on the Red List as Near Threatened (IUCN 2006). The three terrestrial small mammal species recorded during the survey are likewise forest-dependent and include two West African endemics: Edward’s swamp rat Malacomys edwardsi and the shrew Crocidura grandiceps. The latter is ranked as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List and had not been recorded from Ghana since its description. The overall species composition of small mammals indicates high habitat integrity of the Atewa Range Forest Reserve, which constitutes the most signiﬁcant block of Upland Evergreen Forest in Ghana. The integral protection of Atewa is an outstanding priority for the preservation of (sub-) montane forests in West Africa, both for the conservation of small mammals and of biodiversity in general. In accordance with international conservation principles on mining and biodiversity (Dudley and Stolton 2002, Miranda et al. 2005), we recommend that exploration concessions for Atewa are cancelled, that its legal protection status is upgraded, that no development is allowed within the forest reserve, and that eﬀective management measures are implemented.},

Prevalence reached 12.9\% on average, but showed very important variations in both space and time, thus pointing toward a role of local processes in the maintenance and circulation of rodent-borne leptospires in the area. Prevalence peaks may occur during or one month after moderate (100–200 mm) monthly rainfall, suggesting that rodent-borne leptospires may be more prevalent when standing waters are present, but not at their highest levels (i.e., floods). However, this pattern will have to be confirmed through proper diachronic analysis. Finally, an incomplete but significant host-specificity was observed, with L. kirschneri retrieved only in African shrews, and the invasive Rattus norvegicus and the native Mastomys natalensis preferentially infected by L. interrogans and L. borgpeterseni, respectively.

              The Upper Guinea rainforest zone in West Africa is considered a biodiversity hotspot and contains important habitats for threatened and endemic mammals, yet this region remains poorly known particularly for small mammals. The aim of this study was to survey small mammals in a Liberian and Guinean cross-border conservation area, the Ziama-Wonegizi-Wologizi landscape. We recorded a total of 52 small mammal species, including 26 bats, 15 rodents, 10 shrews, one otter-shrew, of which one rodent species was new to science (
              Colomys
              sp. nov.). We also documented the first country records of the bats
              Chaerephon aloysiisabaudiae
              ,
              Pseudoromicia brunnea
              and
              Pipistrellus inexspectatus

              Crocidura douceti
              and
              Crocidura grandiceps
              from Liberia. Furthermore, we recorded the recently described bat
              Nycticeinops
              happoldorum
              from Wologizi and Ziama, and we documented the presence of
              Micropotamogale lamottei
              at Wologizi, which represents the fourth known locality for this globally threatened species. Finally, the forests of Wologizi and Ziama support numerous threatened species. The results of our survey demonstrate the importance of this region for small mammals and support the creation of a transboundary protected area that will encompass the entire forest landscape.},

            Population genetic approaches may be used to investigate dispersal patterns of species living in highly urbanized environment in order to improve management strategies for biodiversity conservation or pest control. However, in such environment, population genetic structure may reflect both current features of the cityscape and urbanization history. This can be especially relevant when focusing on exotic commensal rodents that have been introduced in numerous primary colonial European settlements. Accounting for spatial and temporal cityscape heterogeneity to determine how past and recent demographic events may interplay to shape current population genetic structure of synanthropic rodents may provide useful insights to manage their populations. In this study, we addressed these issues by focusing on the house mouse,
            Mus musculus domesticus
            , in Dakar, Senegal, where the species may have been introduced as soon as Europeans settled in the middle of the nineteenth century. We examined genetic variation at one mitochondrial locus and 15 nuclear microsatellite markers from individuals sampled in 14 sampling sites representing different stages of urbanization history and different socio-economic environments in Dakar. We used various approaches, including model-based genetic clustering and model-free smoothing of pairwise genetic estimates. We further linked observed spatial genetic patterns to historical and current features of Dakar cityscape using random forest and Bayesian conditional autoregressive models. Results are consistent with an introduction of the house mouse at colonial time and the current genetic structure exhibits a gradient-like pattern reflecting the historical process of spatially continuous expansion of the city from the first European settlement. The genetic patterns further suggest that population dynamics of the house mouse is also driven by the spatial heterogeneity of the current cityscape, including socio-economics features, that translate in habitat quality. Our results highlight the potential importance of accounting for past demographic events to understand spatial genetic patterns of nonnative invasive commensal rodents in highly urbanized environment.},

It also displays one of the most extensive floating chromosomal polymorphisms currently known in mammals, showing a non-random spatial distribution of diploid numbers (2N). We combined population dynamics and genetics to determine dispersal and mobility parameters of G. nigeriae in the species distribution range characterized by low 2N. To do so, we performed a three-year long population survey at Gangara, in the central east Niger. We used both time-dependent monitoring trough capture-mark-recapture (CMR) methods and genetic analyses performed on the 134 monitored individuals. CMR results showed low to very low population densities (maximum 27.5 individuals/ha) throughout the study. Abundance cycle was single-phased and strongly dependent on rainfall patterns. Mobility parameters showed very low individual mobility, with means of distance between successive (re) captures (DRS) and maximal distance between (re) captures (DMR) of 7.8 and 14.4 meters, respectively. Genetic analyses revealed significant isolation by distance as well as spatial structuration, thus confirming poor dispersal capacity. Our results are discussed in terms of rodent pest control in arid areas of Niger where cereal crops production is crucial for human food security.},

It has been recommended as a complementary study to design a biological baseline prior to the development of oil palm plantations. It is based on "Terrestrial small mammals” biological model. Thus, terrestrial small mammal richness and abundance were assessed in Sime Darby palm oil company Concession at Bong and Gbarpolu counties in western Liberia. Conventional live-trapped methods using mainly pitfalls and Sherman traps were used to investigate terrestrial small mammals. The combination of these two methods allowed the capture of 76 specimens belonging to 11 species. The most frequent species was Crocidura jouvenetae (39.47 \%) followed by Hylomyscus simus (14.47 \%) and Hybomys planifrons (10.53 \%). Small mammal communities were globally dominated by forest species (Crocidura eburnea, Crocidura jouvenetae, Crocidura muricauda, Crocidura obscurior, Dephomys defua, Hybomys planifrons, Hylomyscus simus and Mus setulosus), which indicates the lower level of forest degradation at this area. These species of rodent and shrew are threatened to disappear due to the conversion of their habitats to palm oil plantations. It is highly recommended that the company preserve intact primary forest relics within oil palm plantations in order to conserve representative sample local biodiversity.},

The Hepatozoon spp. DNA sequences from the rodents were 98–100\% identical to each other and to Hepatozoon spp. DNA sequence from small mammals deposited in GenBank. Five of the sequences from R. rattus (n = 2) and R. norvegicus (n = 3) were 98–99\% identical to Hepatozoon felis (KY649442.1). Sarcocystis dispersa DNA was detected in one R. rattus (2.1\%) and one R. norvegicus (0.8\%).

A potential new Bartonella species, proposed as Candidatus Bartonella mastomydis, was found in three Mastomys individuals and genetically characterized by targeting two housekeeping genes (rpoB and gltA) and the intergenic species region. However, 20.8\% of gray rats were found to be infected with Bartonella spp., and none of the black rats analyzed was positive.

This study documents the richness, abundance, diversity, distribution and conservation status of small mammals at the UGBG. The methodology involved live-trapping using Sherman live-traps. Overall, 39 individuals belonging to three mammalian orders (Rodentia, Soricomorpha and Erinaceomorpha) and seven species, comprising of four rodents, two shrews and one hedgehog were recorded in 1,080 trap-nights. Overall trapping success and species diversity (Shannon-Wiener H’ and Simpson’s 1-D) indices were therefore 3.61\%, 1.59 and 0.76, respectively. Species richness and diversity were highest (four species; Hʹ = 1.33, 1-D = 0.72) in shrubland and lowest (two species; Hʹ = 0.48, 1-D = 0.3) in grassland. Overlaps of species among the study sites were low, with C. olivieri being the only species common to all sites. Crocidura olivieri was the most abundant species (41.2\%) in the forest, whereas M. erythroleucus dominated (81.3\%) in the grassland. Arvicanthis niloticus solatus and C. oliviera were equally abundant in shrubland. Arvicanthis n. solatus, P. daltoni, C. oliviera, C. foxi and A. albiventris are first records for the Accra Plains. These records add to the species list for the Accra Plains, and highlight the importance of the UGBG to small mammal zoogeography and conservation in Ghana.},

Monocotyledons and dicotyledons predominated in the diet in the dry season, with seeds and insects increasing in the diet in the rainy season. The major differences between the ecology of Arvicantthis at Kano and on the East African savanna were that in East Africa the breeding season is longer and begins after the start of the rainy season. These and other dissimilarities between the biology of Arvicanthis in the two areas could be due to the effect of climatic differences on food supply and to the possible existence of different taxonomic groupings of Arvicanthis in the two regions.},

The specimens were also sequenced for cytochrome b to assist in making accurate taxonomic designations. To our knowledge, chromosomal information is presented for four of these small mammal species for the first time from populations within Southwestern Nigeria. The respective diploid numbers detected in this study for Lophuromys sikapusi and Dasymys sp. differ from diploid numbers published for these species in previous studies. Cytochrome b sequencing helped us to correctly identify Mastomys erythroleucus (2n=38), where specimens with this same chromosome number in our study area were erroneously assigned to other Mastomys species.

The exact transmission mode remains unknown but DNA based evidence of Mycobacterium ulcerans, the causative agent, have implicated potential environmental reservoirs, similar to those suspected in the transmission to humans. The role of small mammals in transmission has recently received some research attention. Based on the hypothesis that the overlapping ecology of human and animal habitats would favour mycobacteria transmission, the study aimed to identify BU like infections in small mammals living in close proximity to humans, in endemic communities. One hundred and eleven animals were trapped within five communities in two major endemic areas, Daloa and Tabbo. Majority of trapped small mammals were mice, Mastomys natalensis, of which 8 animals had external lesions. PCR on organ and lesion samples identified, predominantly, mycobacterium spp, of which five mice were positive for IS2404. IS2404 sequencing confirmed infection in two mice as M. ulcerans strain Agy99. Our findings suggest that small terrestrial mammals could be susceptible to mycobacteria, particularly, M. ulcerans, within endemic communities in Côte d’Ivoire. It also consolidates earlier evidence asserting their role as potential environmental reservoirs of M. ulcerans in endemic communities. The potential public health threat from these small mammals warrants an “OneHealth” approach to investigating the ecology and transmission of M. ulcerans in endemic countries.},

	abstract = {Bats were sampled in three National Forests in Liberia using mist nets, a harp trap, and roost searches. Terrestrial small mammals were captured opportunistically and were not used in the final assessment of the forests. A total of 182 bats of 22 species was captured, representing 37\% of the bat species known to occur in Liberia. Species richness was highest at Gola and Grebo National Forests, possibly because secondary forest and forest edge was sampled there. North Lorma National Forest, where only forest interior was surveyed, had both the lowest capture success and the lowest species richness. Three IUCN Red List species were recorded: Rhinolophus hillorum (Vulnerable) in Gola National Forest, Scotonycteris zenkeri (Near Threatened) in Grebo National Forest, and Hipposideros fuliginosus (Near Threatened) in North Lorma National Forest. Bat assemblages in each of the surveyed areas were characterized by forestdependent species. Not a single species typical of savanna habitats was recorded, indicating high habitat integrity of the National Forests. Three species are reported for the first time from Liberia (Rhinolophus landeri, Neoromicia guineensis, Neoromicia aff. grandidieri), raising the species total for the country to 59. An updated checklist with corrected species identifications is presented for the bats of Liberia. Two species of shrews, one murid rodent, five squirrels and one anomalure (scaly-tailed squirrel) were also recorded, including the rarely reported Western Palm Squirrel Epixerus ebii and the Lesser Anomalure Anomalurus cf. pusillus.},

	doi = {10.1896/054.050.0114},
	abstract = {Small mammals (shrews, rodents and bats) were surveyed in the Ajenjua Bepo and Mamang River forest reserves of eastern Ghana. A total of 128 specimens belonging to at least 18 species were recorded including ﬁve species of rodent, six species of shrew and seven bat species. Within Ajenjua Bepo, six shrew species were recorded including four forest species. Despite the high degree of disturbance of the secondary forest, three specimens of Crocidura muricauda were collected. Only three species of murid rodents were collected, with two forest species (Malacomys edwardi and Praomys tullbergi). Six pteropodid bat species and a single insectivorous bat species were recorded. Several of these species were forest-dwelling species. Within the Mamang River Forest Reserve, ﬁve or six shrew species were collected, the dominant species being the forest-dwelling Crocidura obscurior. With a similar trapping eﬀort as at Site 1, a higher number of specimens (39) and species (5) of rodents were recorded within Mamang River. The forest-dwelling Praomys tullbergi was dominant. Only four specimens of a single forest-dwelling bat species (Myonycteris torquata) were recorded within the forest, most likely a result of weather conditions during surveys. Both species richness and species abundance of the forest shrew and murid rodent species point to a higher conservation potential of Mamang River than Ajenjua Bepo. Mamang River appears to present better conservation value due to 1) its larger size, 2) the absence of plantations within Mamang, and 3) the more structured arboreal vegetation within Mamang probably providing more fruit and leaf litter.},

In total, we conﬁrmed the existence of 18 mammals in these forests. The three sites are under immense pressure from slash-and-burn, and are all over-exploited for bushmeat. At Site 3, Boullére, bushﬁres were not uncommon. Large mammals such as pigs and duikers were only rarely directly observed. The major threat has been slash-and-burn farming, plantation agriculture (i.e. palm oil, banana) and bushmeat hunting. Our results show that Sites 1 and 2 are relatively not biologically signiﬁcant for conservation of large mammals. Site 3 however has more contiguous forest and oﬀers good opportunities for conservation of large mammals.},

	abstract = {Although several studies have associated Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU) infection, Buruli ulcer (BU), with slow moving water bodies, there is still no definite mode of transmission. Ecological and transmission studies suggest Variable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR) typing as a useful tool to differentiate MU strains from other Mycolactone Producing Mycobacteria (MPM). Deciphering the genetic relatedness of clinical and environmental isolates is seminal to determining reservoirs, vectors and transmission routes. In this study, we attempted to source-track MU infections to specific water bodies by matching VNTR profiles of MU in human samples to those in the environment. Environmental samples were collected from 10 water bodies in four BU endemic communities in the Ashanti region, Ghana. Four VNTR loci in MU Agy99 genome, were used to genotype environmental MU ecovars, and those from 14 confirmed BU patients within the same study area. Length polymorphism was confirmed with sequencing. MU was present in the 3 different types of water bodies, but significantly higher in biofilm samples. Four MU genotypes, designated W, X, Y and Z, were typed in both human and environmental samples. Other reported genotypes were only found in water bodies. Animal trapping identified 1 mouse with lesion characteristic of BU, which was confirmed as MU infection. Our findings suggest that patients may have been infected from community associated water bodies. Further, we present evidence that small mammals within endemic communities could be susceptible to MU infections. M. ulcerans transmission could involve several routes where humans have contact with risk environments, which may be further compounded by water bodies acting as vehicles for disseminating strains.},

	abstract = {In order to investigate dynamics and reproduction in Mastomys erythroleucus inhabiting a high rainfall area in coastal Guinea, West Africa, a small mammal study was carried out through a 1-year longitudinal survey. Sampling was by standardized trapping in houses, cultivations, forest and savanna. Identification of the small mammals was based on morphology, and by molecular technique for sibling species. As a part of a larger survey on reservoirs of Lassa virus in Guinea, 106/289 specimens were screened for arenavirus and were found negative. The most abundant species was M. erythroleucus (46\%) which occurred in all habitats, with a preference for savanna close to the cultivations. Its reproduction was seasonal and lasted for 8 months, beginning in the early rainy season and finishing in the early dry season. It was syntopic with Lophuromys sikapusi (13\%) and Praomys rostratus (10\%), which probably migrated from forest/orchards to cultivations in the late rainy season. Reproduction was high in many species in the late rainy season, but P. rostratus seemed to reproduce actively in the dry season, in contrast to L. sikapusi. Pygmy mice, Mus (Nannomys) spp., were abundant in the early rainy season only. The high species richness (14) is explained by the combined influence of Sudanian-Guinean-Congolian habitats. The role of the absence of bush fires is also debated in that context.},
