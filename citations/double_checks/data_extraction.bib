  Abstract = {The Lama forest is the largest natural forest in southern Benin, and one of the last remnant forests within the Dahomey Gap. It harbours several species of major importance in terms of conservation. Small mammals are known to represent more than 80\% of the African mammalian species diversity but they have received little attention in Benin. In this article we present the results of the first terrestrial small mammal species inventory (murid rodents and shrews) in the Lama forest. In September and October 2007, we captured 280 small mammals belonging to 12 species, identified by morphological and genetic analysis. We also provide detailed cytogenetic data for six of the 12 captured species. For five of them, we compare our data with previously published karyotypes, and for the sixth one (Hylomyscus pamfi), the karyotype is published here for the first time. Two of the captured species are closed-forest specialists (Praomys misonnei, H. pamfi), and H. pamfi is endemic to the Dahomey Gap region. Our results are congruent with those obtained on other animal groups, and highlight the importance of the Lama forest for the conservation of the country's forest biodiversity.}

  Abstract = {Description of the subject. Rodents may be major pests to crops and stored food, thus threatening food security. Among them, invasive species such as rats and mice are of particular concern since they are disseminated globally following international trade. We investigated the small mammal assemblage within the international seaport of Cotonou, Benin, in order to determine the relative importance and distribution of native vs invasive rodent species, as well as to evaluate the amount and associated costs of rodent-induced damages on imported 'exported stored goods (here, rice). Objectives. Description of rodent assemblages within an African seaport, and evaluation of the associated damages on stored food stocks. Method. Rodent communities were described following trapping results while associated damages and costs were evaluated following a 25 days-long monitoring campaign and subsequent economic estimation of loss. Results. Our results show that invasive mice and rats are, from far, the most impacting rodents in the storage warehouses, and that the associated economic losses are quite large. Moreover, we point towards a few environmental management procedures that may greatly reduce the impact of rodents on stored goods. Conclusions. Damages and costs due to invasive rodents within the Cotonou Harbor are so that they justify financial investment in rodent population control.}

  Abstract = {Risks related to Toxoplasma gondii infection in humans remain poorly known in Senegal. Although rodent surveys could help to assess the circulation of T. gondii, they have seldom been set up in sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of this study was to examine Toxoplasma seroprevalence in rodents from villages and towns across Senegal. Rodents were sampled in 40 localities using a standardised trapping protocol. Detection of T. gondii antibodies was performed on 1205 rodents, using a modified agglutination test (MAT) technique. Seroprevalence data were analysed depending on geography, the local rodent community, and individual characteristics of the rodent hosts. We found 44 seropositive rodents from four different species (Mastomys erythroleucus, Mastomys natalensis, Mus musculus domesticus, Rattus rattus). Toxoplasma seroprevalence was low, averaging 4\% in the localities. Higher Toxoplasma seroprevalence (up to 24\%) was found in northern Senegal, a region known to be the heart of pastoral herding in the country.}

  Issn = {1756-3305},
  Abstract = {Background: Lassa fever, killing thousands of people annually, is the most reported viral zoonotic disease in Nigeria. Recently, different rodent species carrying diverse lineages of the Lassa virus (LASV) in addition to a novel Mobala-like genetic sequence were detected within the country. Here, screening 906 small mammal specimens from 11 localities for IgG antibodies and incorporating previous PCR detection data involving the same populations, we further describe arenavirus prevalence across Nigeria in relation to host species and geographical location. Methods: Small mammals were trapped during the period 2011-2015 according to geographical location (endemic and non endemic zones for Lassa fever), season (rainy and dry seasons between 2011 and 2012 for certain localities) and habitat (indoois, peridomestic settings and sylvatic vegetation). identification of animal specimens from genera such as Mastomys and Mus (Nannomys) was assisted by DNA sequencing. Small mammals were tested for LASV IgG antibody using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Results: Small mammals were infected in both the endemic and non-endemic zones for Lassa fever, with a wider range of species IgG-positive (n = 8) than those which had been previously detected to be PCR-positive (n = 3). IgG-positive species, according to number of infected individuals, were Mastomys natalensis (n = 40), Mastomys erythroleucus (n = 15), Praomys daltoni (n = 6), Mus baoulei (n = 5), Rattus rattus (n = 2), Crocidura spp. (n = 2), Mus minutoides (n = 1) and Praomys misonnei (n = 1). Multimammate mice (Mastomys natalensis and M. erythroleucus) were the most ubiquitously infected, with animals testing positive by either PCR or IgG in 7 out of the 11 localities sampled IgG prevalence in M. natalensis ranged from 1\% in Abagboro, 17-36\% in Eguare Egoro, Ekpoma and Ngel Nyaki, up to 52 \% in Mayo Ranewo. Prevalence according to locality, season and age was not, however, statistically significant for M. natalensis in Eguare Egoro and Ekpoma, localities that were sampled longitudinally. Conclusions: Overall, our study demonstrates that arenavirus occurrence is probably more widely distributed geographically and in extent of host taxa than is currently realized. This expanded scope should be taken into consideration in Lassa fever control efforts. further sampling should also be carried out to isolate and characterize potential arenaviruses present in small mammal populations we found to be seropositive.}

  Abstract = {The Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis) is the reservoir host of Lassa arenavirus, the etiological agent of Lassa fever in humans. Because there exists no vaccine for human use, rodent control and adjusting human behavior are currently considered to be the only options for Lassa fever control. In order to develop efficient rodent control programs, more information about the host's ecology is needed. In this study, we investigated the spatial behavior of M. natalensis and other small rodents in two capture-mark-recapture and four dyed bait (Rhodamine B) experiments in Lassa fever-endemic villages in Upper Guinea. During the capture-mark-recapture studies, 23\% of the recaptured M. natalensis moved between the houses and proximate fields. While M. natalensis was found over the entire study grid (2ha), other rodent species (Praomys daltoni, Praomys rostratus, Lemniscomys striatus, Mus spp.) were mostly trapped in the surrounding fields. Distances between recapture occasions never exceeded 100m for all rodent species. During the dyed bait experiments, 11\% of M. natalensis and 41\% of P. daltoni moved from the fields to houses. We conclude that commensal M. natalensis easily moves between houses and proximate fields in Guinea. We therefore consider occasional domestic rodent elimination to be an unsustainable approach to reduce Lassa virus transmission risk to humans, as M. natalensis is likely to reinvade houses quickly from fields in which rodents are not controlled. A combination of permanent rodent elimination with other control strategies (e.g., make houses rodent proof or attract predators) could be more effective for Lassa fever control, but must be further investigated.}

  Abstract = {Some small mammals occur as household pests and harbour a number of parasites that could be of public health importance. This study profiled the helminth and protozoan parasites in trapped small mammals within and around human dwelling places (houses) located across 4 major towns (Auchi, Benin, Ekpoma, and Uromi) and environs in Edo state, Nigeria. Six genera (Apodemus sp., Crocidura sp., Mastomys natalensis, Mus musculus, Rattus sp., and Sorex sp.) were identified from 502 trapped small mammals. Overall, M. musculus (71.9\%) and Rattus rattus (20.1\%) were the most frequently trapped. In total, on examination of blood, gastrointestinal contents, and brain tissues, 12 helminth taxa (Angiostrongylus sp., Aspicularis sp., Capillaria sp., Gongylonema sp., Heterakis spumosa, Hymenolepis diminuta, Hymenolepis nana, Mastophorus muris, Moniliformis moniliformis, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, Strongyloides sp., Trichosomoides sp., and Trichuris sp.), and 6 protozoan parasites (Babesia sp., Trypanosoma lewisi, Plasmodium sp., Eimeria sp., Isospora sp., and Toxoplasma gondii) were isolated. Most prevalent helminths with relatively heavy mean intensity were Strongyloides sp. and Heterakis spumosa, while Plasmodium, Eimeria, and Isospora were the most prevalent protozoan parasites. Generally, intrinsic factors like sex and age had marginal influence on the rate and burden of infection in M. musculus and R. rattus. Although the infection rate and prevalence of zoonotic parasites were low, they were largely recovered in rodents from Ekpoma. This study elucidates the public health implication of the presence of zoonotic parasites in these small mammals.}

  Abstract = {Coastal wetlands in Ghana are under severe threat of anthropogenic drivers of habitat degradation and climate change, thereby increasing the need for assessment and monitoring to inform targeted and effective conservation of these ecosystems. Here, we assess small mammal species richness, relative abundance and body mass in three habitats at the Muni-Pomadze Ramsar site of Ghana, and compare these to baseline data gathered in 1997 to evaluate changes in the wetland ecosystem. Small mammals were live-trapped using Sherman collapsible and pitfall traps. We recorded 84 individuals of 10 species in 1485 trap-nights, whereas the baseline study recorded 45 individuals of seven species in 986 trap-nights. The overall trap-success was therefore greater in the present study (5.66 \%) than the baseline study (4.56 \%). The species richness increased from one to four in the forest, and from zero to eight in the thicket, but decreased from six to four in the grassland. The total number of individuals increased in all habitats, with the dominant species in the grassland shifting from Lemniscomys striatus to Mastomys erythroleucus. Three species, Malacomys edwardsi, Grammomys poensis and Praomys tullbergi are the first records for the Muni-Pomadze Ramsar site. Generally, the average body mass of individual species in the grassland was lower in the present study. The considerable changes in small mammal community structure suggest changes in the wetland ecosystem. The conservation implications of our findings are discussed.}

  Abstract = {Lassa virus (LASV) is endemic to parts of West Africa and causes highly fatal hemorrhagic fever. The multimammate rat (Mastomys natalensis) is the only known reservoir of LASV. Most human infections result from zoonotic transmission. The very diverse LASV genome has 4 major lineages associated with different geographic locations. We used reverse transcription PCR and resequencing microarrays to detect LASV in 41 of 214 samples from rodents captured at 8 locations in Sierra Leone. Phylogenetic analysis of partial sequences of nucleoprotein (NP), glycoprotein precursor (GPO), and polymerase (L) genes showed 5 separate clades within lineage IV of LASV in this country. The sequence diversity was higher than previously observed; mean diversity was 7.01\% for nucleoprotein gene at the nucleotide level. These results may have major implications for designing diagnostic tests and therapeutic agents for LASV infections in Sierra Leone.}

Overall, 39 individuals belonging to three mammalian orders (Rodentia, Soricomorpha and Erinaceomorpha) and seven species, comprising of four rodents, two shrews and one hedgehog were recorded in 1,080 trap-nights. Overall trapping success and species diversity (Shannon-Wiener H' and Simpson's 1-D) indices were therefore 3.61\%, 1.59 and 0.76, respectively. Species richness and diversity were highest ( four species; H' = 1.33, 1-D = 0.72) in shrubland and lowest (two species; H' = 0.48, 1-D = 0.3) in grassland. Overlaps of species among the study sites were low, with C. olivieri being the only species common to all sites. Crocidura olivieri was the most abundant species (41.2\%) in the forest, whereas M. erythroleucus dominated (81.3\%) in the grassland. Arvicanthis niloticus solatus and C. oliviera were equally abundant in shrubland. Arvicanthis n. solatus, P. daltoni, C. oliviera, C. foxi and A. albiventris are first records for the Accra Plains. These records add to the species list for the Accra Plains, and highlight the importance of the UGBG to small mammal zoogeography and conservation in Ghana.}

Using 5014 trap-nights, 91 individuals were captured that comprised seven rodent and four shrew species. The trapping success was significantly different for each species, i.e., the Longworth traps captured more soricids (31/36 shrews), whereas the Sherman traps captured more murids (37/55 mice). The most frequent species was Praomys cf. rostratus, followed by Crocidura buettikoferi, Hybomys trivirgatus and Crocidura jouvenetae. Indices of species richness (S) and diversity (H') were greatest in primary forest, followed by secondary forest and swamp. - Several expected species, such as Crocidura obscurior, were not found, whereas we captured four specimens of the critically endangered (IUCN 2012) Wimmer's shrew Crocidura wimmeri, a species that has vanished from its type locality, Adiopodoume.

Accumulation curve indicated that the rodent community was well sampled. Murine rodents were far more numerous than gerbilline rodents, and among them, Mastomys erythroleucus was the dominant species, being caught in high numbers in all habitats. Arvicanthis niloticus and Praomys daltoni were also abundant, followed by Mastomys natalensis and Gerbilliscus guineae. Abundances were high at the beginning of the rainy season when reproductive activity was low in all species. At the end of the rainy season, murine rodents were actively involved in reproduction, while gerbilline rodents were at their lowest density. Significant changes in relative abundance among habitats (including human dwellings) were observed between periods in some species, suggesting seasonal trends in habitat preferences. This may help species coexistence in this species-rich rodent community, in an area likely to be submitted to significant habitat alterations in the years to come.}

The University of Ghana Campus, Legon (UGCL) was divided into two sites: built-up area and the botanical garden, which is less developed. The small mammals were live-trapped using Sherman traps in May 2009 for seven nights by means of transect in the two study sites, using a mixture of peanut butter and corn meal as the preferred bait. The 350 trap-nights yielded 68 captures of five species of small mammals. They were (i) Pygmy mouse (Mus musculoides), (ii) Unstriped grass rat (Arvicanthis niloticus), (iii) Tullberg's soft-furred rat (Praomys tullbergi), (iv) African giant shrew (Crocidura olivieri) and (v) White-bellied hedgehog (Atelerix albiventris). Small mammal diversity and abundance were similar between the two sites. This may be due to the comparatively large size and the presence of green areas in the built-up area. The preference of C. olivieri for human-interfered habitats may be used to monitor further habitat modification through real estate development in UGCL.}

On the basis of morphological, morphometric and cytogenetic characters, we describe these animals as a new species. The distinguishing characteristics of the new species, with respect to D. melanotis and D. mystacalis from Gabon and Ghana, include the absence of a dorsal stripe and a larger body size. The new species is also smaller in size than D. oreas from Mount Cameroon. The new species has morphological similarities with karyo-typed specimens of D. messorius from Ippy (Central African Republic) and the so-called D. melanotis from La Maboke, Gabon, but has a distinct karyotype. It is close in morphology to D. messorius from the Cameroon lowlands. This is the first time G and C banding were employed for members of the genus Dendromus, and the karyotype of the new species confirms that it may be a sibling species of the D. messorius "complex", for which the distribution and measure of species diversity in west central Africa are far from resolved. The new species occurs in Guinean and Liberian montane savannas of Mount Nimba and in banana and quinine plantations around Mount Ziama, Guinea. It is also known from the Ivory Coast. The presence of this new species highlights the importance of altitude savannas and forests of the Nimba region for conservation.}

  Abstract = {The island syndrome is the name given to the particularities of the behavioural, morphological and demographical characteristics of island populations. As concerns demography, the island syndrome model states that densities and survival are greater in island than in mainland populations. Most previous studies aimed at confirming this prediction for small mammals have addressed species from the North Temperate Zone. Here, we tested the demographic expectations of the island syndrome using data gathered over two years for island and mainland populations of two African rodent species, Mastomys erytholeucus and Mastomys huberti, at two different sites in Senegal. Capture-Mark-Recapture methods allowing for variation in catchability of the individuals were used to yield estimates of both abundance (or density) and probability of survival and seniority (which is a demographic parameter inversely related to recruitment). As predicted from the island syndrome, survival and densities were indeed higher in island populations for the two study sites; however, only for the population with stronger island syndrome was the difference in survival biologically important. Estimates of the probability of seniority were similar for island and mainland populations at the two sites. Our findings provide support for the demographic expectations of the model of island syndrome in an Afrotropical context and thus confirm the general applicability of this syndrome while revealing differences according to particular insular situations.

  Issn = {1616-5047},
  Abstract = {Southern Mali mainly belongs to the Sudanian savanna bioclimatic zone, but forest patches showing botanical affinities with Guinean humid forest remain as gallery forests or ravine forests. To characterize the rodent diversity of this area and check for the presence of some species of Guinean affinities in this group, rodent assemblages were sampled in four regions of southern Mali, using trapping and observational data in forest and surrounding habitats. Twenty-four species were recorded, comprising a representative sample of the expected overall diversity in this group according to rarefaction curves. Praomys rostratus was the dominant species in the most humid, closed lowland forest. Praomys daltoni was also present in this habitat type, being all the more abundant as habitat degradation was apparent. It became the dominant species in ravine forest on rocky substrate where P. rostratus was completely absent. In Sudanian savanna habitats and in herbaceous and cultivated areas, Mastomys erythroleucus dominated a diverse rodent community. A few species were found that testified for Guinean affinities of the most humid forest patches, especially in the extreme southeast of the country (region of Sikasso). Rodent assemblages of the Bafing and Mts Mandingues areas, in the western part of the study area, showed the highest similarity, in relation with environmental characteristics of this region representing an extension of the Fouta Djallon plateau in Guinea. The results obtained highlight the high biodiversity value of this forest-savanna mosaic, and provide new arguments in favour of the preservation of West African forest patches and their surrounding habitats.

  Abstract = {We performed a terrestrial small mammal species inventory in the Agoua and Wari-Maro forest reserves (Benin). Four localities were sampled, and in each locality, three habitats were surveyed: dense forest, open forest or woodland savannah and shrub savannah. This is the first comprehensive inventory for small mammals in central Benin. We captured 794 small mammals representing twenty species (six shrew species, fourteen rodent species). Three new species that need to be described were recorded. We observed a mixture of both true forest species and of species adapted to a wider range of habitats ranging from savannah to forest clearings. Species with either Sudanian or Guinea-Congolian affinities were recorded, as well as a new species endemic to Togo and Benin. This rich biodiversity underlines the urgent need for an effective protection of these forests. The Sudanian species Crocidura cf. foxi was more abundant in Wari-Maro than in Agoua forest, while the Guineo-Congolian species Praomys misonnei and Hylomyscus sp were only captured in Agoua forest. These results are in agreement with the fact that these two forests belong to two distinct chorological zones.},

  Abstract = {Expansion of human activities in the Sudanian savannah is changing natural habitats together with their animal communities. The abundance and diversity of small mammal communities were investigated in human-influenced savannahs in close proximity to Niokolo Koba National Park (NKNP) in south-eastern Senegal and compared with those from NKNP. Two localities were sampled in natural and two in human-influenced areas during two dry and two rainy seasons. Total sampling effort was 5400 trap-nights. Ninety-eight individuals of eleven species were captured outside NKNP, while only 28 individuals of five rodent species were caught inside the park (all of which were found also outside NKNP). The most abundant species outside NKNP was Mastomys erythroleucus, while inside NKNP it was Praomys daltoni. Both relative abundance and diversity were significantly higher in human-influenced landscape than in natural savannahs of NKNP. The difference in species richness may be linked with lower population densities of certain species in NKNP and the effect of traditional agriculture, which may support the presence of species typical for deforested landscape. Furthermore, food availability, and predator abundances are discussed as possible reasons for the higher rodent abundances outside NKNP.}

Prevalence and abundance levels of cestodes were very high in A. niloticus, especially in adults. Seasonal and habitat effects were found in both cestode communities of M. erythroleucus and A. niloticus.

The between-sex difference was statistically significant =2.64, P {\textless} 0.05) with more ma/es (53.2 \%) than females (46.8 \%) harbouring helminth parasites. There was no marked variation in the infection pattern in the rat host from the different habitats, but the parasite prevalence and distribution appeared to be season-dependent. Parasites (n = 1469) recovered were of 3 helminth groups (nematodes 72.4\%, cestodes 27,5\%, and trematodes 0.6\%). Six nematode species identified were Nippostrongylus braziliensis (19.8\%), Aspicularis tetraptera (17.5\%), Syphacia muris 17,0 \%), Angiostrongy/us cantonensis 16.9\%), Strongy/oides ratti (16.0\%) and Capi//aria hepatica (12,8\%).

  Abstract = {In order to investigate dynamics and reproduction in Mastomys erythroleucus inhabiting a high rainfall area in coastal Guinea, West Africa, a small mammal study was carried out through a I-year longitudinal survey. Sampling was by standardized trapping in houses, cultivations, forest and savanna. Identification of the small mammals was based on morphology, and by molecular technique for sibling species. As a part of a larger survey on reservoirs of Lassa virus in Guinea, 106/289 specimens were screened for arenavirus and were found negative. The most abundant species was M. erythroleucus (46\%) which occurred in all habitats, with a preference for savanna close to the cultivations. Its reproduction was seasonal and lasted for 8 months, beginning in the early rainy season and finishing in the early dry season. It was syntopic with Lophuromys sikapusi (13\%) and Praomys rostratus (10\%), which probably migrated from forest/orchards to cultivations in the late rainy season. Reproduction was high in many species in the late rainy season, but P. rostratus seemed to reproduce actively in the dry season, in contrast to L. sikapusi. Pygmy mice, Mus (Nannomys) spp., were abundant in the early rainy season only. The high species richness (14) is explained by the combined influence of Sudanian-Guinean-Congolian habitats. The role of the absence of bush fires is also debated in that context.}

This study was carried out to establish the identities of murid rodent populations and to compare their diversity between forest and derived savanna sites within south western Nigeria. Identification of captured specimens was carried out by multivariate statistics of body and skull measurements, and also by analysis of certain discrete characters. Six species were identified: Praomys tullbergi, Hylomyscus stella, Mastomys natalensis, Arvicanthis rufinus, Lemniscomys striatus and Lophuromys sikapusi. Forest sites possessed a higher Shannon's diversity index (1.685) than the derived savanna sites (0.978), containing a higher number of taxa and larger abundance of murid rodents. This underscores the negative impact that encroachment of the derived savanna has upon diversity of animals in areas that were once forest.},

  Abstract = {Multimammate rats of the genus Mastomys are among the most widespread pest species in Africa. Previous studies of Mastomys population dynamics have generally reported variation in abundance but few have investigated the demographic parameters underlying this variation, and in particular recruitment. Capture-mark-recapture data were collected for Mastomys erythroleucus several times a year from 2000 to 2004 at a site annually flooded by the Niger River in Mali. Closed-population models were used to estimate population abundance. Both seniority (a parameter inversely linked to recruitment) and survival probabilities were estimated by capture-mark-recapture models. The impacts of water level, population abundance and cumulative rainfall were assessed for each demographic parameter. Survival probabilities (local survival) were negatively correlated with water level, suggesting that rodents emigrated out of the study zone during flooding. As for seniority probabilities, 86\% of temporal variation was explained by a model with season, abundance, water level and the interaction between abundance and water level. This suggests that density-dependence in recruitment was mediated by intraspecific competition for food or refuge from floodwaters, or by predation. The flood of the Niger River greatly impacts Mastomys erythroleucus population dynamics, affecting both survival and seniority probabilities.},

  Abstract = {Lassa fever is a hemorrhagic fever caused by all arenavirus, which affects approximately 150,000 persons per year in West Africa. It is principally transmitted by rodents of the genus Mastomys, which serve as both reservoir and vector of the virus. This study tested the hypothesis that human Lassa fever in Guinea is related to the occurrence rate of the multimammate rat, Mastomys spp, inside houses. The analysis was based both on Lassa virus antibody surveys in the human Population and the commensal rodent distribution in the same prefectures. The analysis took into account several data sets compiled from the literature (Lukashevich et al., 1993; Demby et al., 2001) and data from Our own ongoing rodent trapping activities in Guinea. The analysis revealed a probable regional gradient of introduced rodent species in houses, with the black rat, Rattus rattus, predominating on the coast and the house mouse, Mus musculus, predominating approximately 200 kin southeast to the coast. The autochthonous species, Mastomys spp, were present deep inside the Country, from High to Forest Guinea. The regression analysis of Mastomys occurrence on human Lassa virus antibody prevalence showed a positive correlation in six administrative regional districts (prefectures) between an increasing Mastomys occurrence and increasing seroprevalence. A seventh prefecture, where mainly M. musculus occurred, was discordant with this trend, and possible explanations for this divergence are discussed. The partial replacement of Mastomys by other species, especially R. rattus and Myomys daltoni, is discussed as a potential explanation for the low-prevalence of Lassa fever in certain areas.}

  Abstract = {A capture-mark-release program was run for 3 years in a rice-growing area of the inner delta of the Niger River in central Mali to monitor population dynamics of a major pest species, the multimammate rat Mastomys huberti. The abundance pattern showed a phase of low-to-medium abundances (June 2000-March 2002) leading to a peak (October 2002) followed by a dramatic crash ending in total Population disappearance induced by general flooding of the area in October 2003. Reproduction started well after the end of the rainy season, contrary to observations for this genus elsewhere. Survival was very low between the end of the rainy season and the middle of the dry season, then high during the rest of the dry season. The annual flood of the Niger River was found to have a major influence oil Population and spatial dynamics of M. huberti in this area by eliminating available ground surface in high-flood years, thus causing local extinction, and by delaying the onset of reproduction to the beginning of the dry season. Overall, the dynamics of multimammate rats in the inner delta of the Niger River appeared to be linked to rainfall and flooding patterns in a complex way. Maximum demographic growth appeared to be associated with intermediate levels of flood height, consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis.},

  Volume = {31},
  Year = {2004},
  Issn = {0305-0270},
  Abstract = {Introduction: The genus Arvicanthis (Lesson 1842) (Rodentia: Murinae), usually referred to as the unstriped grass rat, is mainly distributed in savanna and grassland habitats of Sub-Saharan Africa. Among the four chromosomal forms of Arvicanthis recently differentiated in Western and Central Africa, the one with a diploid chromosomal number (2n) of 62 and an autosomal fundamental number (NFa) of 62 or 64 is ascribed to Arvicanthis niloticus (Demarest 1822), while the one with 2n=62 and a NFa between 74 and 76 is referred to A. ansorgei (Thomas 1910). Despite the broad area of sympatry recently uncovered along the inner delta of the Niger river in Mali [details in Volobouev et al. (2002) Cytogenetics and Genome Research, 96, 250-260], the distribution of the two species is largely parapatric and follows the latitudinal patterns of the West-African biogeographical domains, which are related to the latitudinal patterns of annual rainfall in this region. Here, we analyse the suggestion that the two species show specific adaptations to differences in climate aridity. Methods: Karyologically screened animals were sampled in 19 localities in seasonally flooded regions located along the 'Niger' river in Mali and extending from 1100 to 200 mm of mean annual rainfall. The analysis of trapping success (TS) data allowed us to investigate the respective effects of climate (i.e. annual rainfall) and local (i.e. duration of the green herbaceous vegetation) aridity on the latitudinal and habitat distribution of the two species. Conclusions: The broad zone of sympatry was found to correspond to a northward expansion of the recognized distribution area of A. ansorgei. TS values indicated that the two species responded very differently to climatic and local conditions of aridity. Arvicanthis ansorgei decreased in TS as regional conditions became more arid; a similar trend was also observed within regions where habitat occupancy decreased with local aridity. The higher TS observed in the most humid habitat relative to the others persisted throughout the latitudinal rainfall gradient. In contrast, TS of A. niloticus increased with latitudinal aridity. This species was present in more and habitats than A. ansorgei from 1000 mm down to 400 mm of mean annual rainfall where a shift to the most humid habitat occurred. These opposite trends in TS distribution between species suggest that A. ansorgei is less adapted than A. niloticus to and environments at both a regional and habitat level; thus, A. ansorgei would be able to invade dry regions only along the extensive floodplains bordering the inner delta of the 'Niger' river. Several biological traits that may be involved in limiting the southward distribution of A. niloticus are discussed.},

  Abstract = {1. Due to the existence of numerous morphologically sibling species among African rodent genera, cytogenetical analyses are essential for correct taxonomic identifications. As an illustration, karyotypes of rodents captured in the Lake Chad area were systematically conducted, to determine them unambiguously. 2. Thirteen species were found, giving a list of at least 18 species in total for the whole Lake Chad region when previously published data were critically re-examined. Gerbilline rodents dominate in this Sahelian region, with five species of Gerbillus, four of Taterillus, two of Tatera and Desmodilliscus braueri, and six species of murine rodents were also counted. Moreover, two species of Taterillus appeared characterized by unique and hitherto unknown karyotypes, and undoubtedly represent new species. 3. The Lake Chad area, although poorly studied from a biogeographical point of view, occupies a central position in the northern half of Africa which makes its zoogeographical affinities interesting to evaluate. Analysis of the biogeographical characteristics of the rodent species recorded here leads to the conclusion that the murid rodent community of the Lake Chad region is of mixed origin, with a dominant West African component. However, the presence of two species considered as endemics (Mastomys verheyeni and Taterillus lacustris), combined with our discovery of two new chromosomal species of Taterillus, suggest that this region may have acted as a centre of differentiation in relatively recent times, perhaps reflecting the extensive variations of the Lake Chad basin associated with Plio-Pleistocene cycles of transgression-regression. 4. Without chromosomal data, most of these findings would have remained weakly supported, or even undiscovered, as between five and eight species could have been overlooked.},

  Abstract = {Ten species of rodents were trapped from cocoa groves, abandoned agricultural land and a rice field during the wet season in eastern Sierra Leone. Trap success varied between 0.8\% and 14.1\%. Mean corrected trap success was 6.4\%. Data are analyzed in terms of habitat preferences of individual species, community composition and species richness. Results of dietary analysis are presented. The data indicate that the rodent fauna of cocoa groves contains both savanna-derived and forest-derived elements, though some habitat specialist species were absent. Habitats with a high percentage of understory cover showed a higher rodent species diversity and biomass than those with a sparse understory. The habitats contained 43\% of the predicted small mammal fauna, including 33\% of the forest-dwelling species. Missing species were mostly arboreal forms. Cocoa groves may provide important refugia for forest-derived small mammal species in areas where deforestation has been extensive.}

  Abstract = {Small mammal communities (shrews and rodents) were studied using mark-and-recapture techniques from November 1991 to June 1992 at six sites on the Accra Plains of Ghana. The sites were two traditionally protected 'sacred groves', two plots in the legally protected Shai Hills Resource Reserve, and two fire-protected sites: secondary forest and a Gmelina tree plantation. A total of 241 individuals representing four species of shrews and nine species of rodents was caught. Abundance, diversity, and composition of small mammals varied greatly between sites. Praomys tullbergi was the most abundant species in the sacred groves, whereas Mastomys erythroleucus dominated in the fire-protected site and in the plantation. The more open grassland areas in the Shai Hills were dominated by Lemniscomys striatus and Uranomys ruddi. Shrews were caught only in forests having dense leaf litter. Legally protected reserve sites had the highest diversity of small mammals but population densities were low. In contrast, the sacred groves had lower diversity levels but much higher population densities, resulting in 1.9 to 14.6 times the biomass of any of the other sites. The rodents Mus minutoides and Hylomyscus alleni and the shrews Crocidura buettikoferi and C. lamottei were found only in the sacred groves. Sacred groves play an important socio-cultural role. Their local ecological and economic importance as reservoirs for rare and useful plants is well known. This study shows that they are also important refuges for certain small mammal species and support characteristic mammal communities. An attempt to measure the impact of the invading exotic tree Azadirachta indica (neem tree) on small mammals was inconclusive, although trapping success was low in areas with dense stands of neem.},

  Abstract = {We report results of a longitudinal survey designed to determine the importance and the dynamics of Borrelia crocidurae, the spirochete responsible for tick-borne relapsing fever in West Africa in rodents and insectivores in a rural area of northern Senegal. A total of 954 animals were caught during bimonthly capture sessions over a two-year period. Positive thick blood smears were recorded in 17.6\% of the 740 rodents and 7.3\% of the 55 musk shrews tested. Variations of prevalence were analyzed in Arvicanthis niloticus and Mastomys huberti, which represented 62.7\% and 28.3\%, respectively, of the animals captured, and 65.7\% and 27.6\%, respectively, of the animals found infected. Borrelia crocidurae prevalence was significantly different between captures and fluctuated separately for each species. Age-specific prevalence of B. crocidurae showed distinct patterns, decreasing with age from 50\% in younger juveniles to 3\% in older adults for A. niloticus, while increasing with age from 8\% to 23\% for M. huberti. No relationship was observed with animal abundance or with the season of the year for either species. These findings suggest that the diversity of the population dynamics of host-vector-parasite associations in the Sahel region of Senegal may be a key factor for the relative stability of the borreliosis reservoir.},

  Abstract = {Wild black rats (Rattus rattus) inhabiting Abule Egba landfill (AEL) were used as zoomonitor to assess health risk associated with exposure to hazardous chemicals from landfills. Twenty five R. rattus (16 and 9) captured within AEL and 15 (9 and 6) (control) caught from Iyano Ipaja (10 km away from AEL) were examined for bone marrow micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCE) and polychromatic erythrocytes/normochromatic erythrocytes (PCE/NCE) ratio, abnormal sperm morphology, alterations in hematological indices and erythrocyte morphology, and histopathology of the viscera using standard protocols. There was significant (p {\textless} 0.05) increase in MNPCE but decrease PCE/NCE ratio in bone marrow cells of exposed rats than the reference site. MNPCE was insignificantly higher in male than females. Cauda epididymal sperms from exposed rats showed significant high frequency of teratozoospermia. Erythrocyte count, hemoglobin concentrations, percentage hematocrits, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations, leucocyte count, and lymphocytes decreased while mean corpuscular volume, neutrophils, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin increased in the exposed rats compared to the control. Also, abnormal erythrocyte morphology: acanthocytes, codocytes (target cells), schizocytes, and tear drops significantly increased in the exposed rats. Marginal sexual dimorphism was observed between males and females in the incidence of hematological indices. Histopathological lesions including interstitial edema, hemorrhage, lymphoid depletion, cellular infiltrations, proliferation of the alveolar pneumocytes, necrosis, tissue degeneration, and reduced germinal epithelium were observed in the testes, liver, lungs, heart, kidney, and spleen from the exposed rats compared to the control. Some physicochemicals and metals analyzed in leachates from the landfill are capable of inducing genome instability and systemic toxicity in the exposed rats. Rattus rattus exposed to hazardous chemicals from AEL harbored somatic and germ cell mutations, and tissue damage compared to the control rats. We suggest that R. rattus are useful sentinel for genotoxicity and system toxicity assessment of landfill-polluted sites.Graphical abstract.},

  Abstract = {The Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis) is the reservoir host of Lassa virus (LASV), an arenavirus that causes Lassa haemorrhagic fever in humans in West Africa. While previous studies suggest that spillover risk is focal within rural villages due to the spatial behaviour of the rodents, the level of clustering was never specifically assessed. Nevertheless, detailed information on the spatial distribution of infected rodents would be highly valuable to optimize LASV-control campaigns, which are limited to rodent control or interrupting human-rodent contact considering that a human vaccine is not available. Here, we analysed data from a four-year field experiment to investigate whether LASV-infected rodents cluster in households in six rural villages in Guinea. Our analyses were based on the infection status (antibody or PCR) and geolocation of rodents (n = 864), and complemented with a phylogenetic analysis of LASV sequences (n = 119). We observed that the majority of infected rodents were trapped in a few houses (20\%) and most houses were rodent-free at a specific point in time (60\%). We also found that LASV strains circulating in a specific village were polyphyletic with respect to neighbouring villages, although most strains grouped together at the sub-village level and persisted over time. In conclusion, our results suggest that: (i) LASV spillover risk is heterogeneously distributed within villages in Guinea; (ii) viral elimination in one particular village is unlikely if rodents are not controlled in neighbouring villages. Such spatial information should be incorporated into eco-epidemiological models that assess the cost-efficiency of LASV control strategies.},

  Abstract = {Small mammals are the natural reservoirs for many zoonotic pathogens. Using molecular tools, we assessed the prevalence of bacteria and protozoans in small mammals and their ectoparasites in Faladje, Bougouni, and Bamoko, Mali. A total of 130 small mammals belonging to 10 different species were captured, of which 74 (56.9\%) were infested by ectoparasites, including Laelaps echidnina, Xenopsylla cheopis, Amblyomma variegatum, Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato, and Haemaphysalis spp. nymphs. DNA of Bartonella was found in 14/75 (18.7\%), 6/48 (12.5\%), and 3/7 (42.8\%) small mammals from Faladje, Bougouni, and Bamako, respectively. In Faladje, Bartonella DNA was detected in 31/68 (45.6\%) of L. echidnina and 14/22 (63.6\%) of X. cheopis. In Bougouni, it was found in 2/26 (7.7\%) of L. echidnina and 10/42 (23.8\%) of X. cheopis. The sequences of Bartonella obtained from small mammals were close to those of Bartonella mastomydis, Bartonella elizabethae, and uncultured Bartonella spp. In Faladje, Coxiella burnetii DNA was detected in 64.4\% (29/45) of Haemaphysalis spp. ticks, 4.5\% (2/44) of Mastomys erythroleucus, 12.5\% (1/8) of Praomys daltoni, and 1.5\% (1/68) of L. echidnina. We found DNA of Wolbachia in X. cheopis from Faladje and DNA of Rickettsia africae and Ehrlichia ruminantium in Am. variegatum from Bougouni. The results of our study show that several small mammal species harbor and may serve as potential reservoirs of Bartonella spp., likely to play a major role in the maintenance, circulation, and potential transmission of bacteria in Mali. The pathogenicity of these bacteria for humans or animals remains to be demonstrated.},

We conducted a prospective study to detect L. major in rodents, animals which are described as reservoir of the parasite. Rodents were caught in five city areas from November 2005 to October 2006. Giemsa stained smears were realized from the cutaneous lesions when present after macroscopic examination of external lesions. The spleen of each rodent was sterilely removed and split into 3 parts for microscopic examination of smears, culture on NNN media and PCR, respectively. A total of 101 rodents belonging to 9 genera were trapped. All the direct examinations and cultures were negative. By using PCR of lesions and spleen samples, three animals were found infected by L. major: one out of 24 (4.2\%) Mastomys natalensis; one out of 8 (12.5\%) Taterillus sp. and one out of three Cricetomys gambianus. This is the first detection of L. major in rodent species in Burkina Faso. Further studies are needed to confirm their role as reservoirs of L. major.},

  Abstract = {The Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis) is the reservoir host of Lassa virus, an arenavirus that causes Lassa haemorrhagic fever in humans in West Africa. Because no vaccine exists and therapeutic options are limited, preventing infection through rodent control and human behavioural measures is currently considered to be the only option. In order to assess the efficacy of rodent control, we performed a 4-year field experiment in rural Upper Guinea and developed a mathematical model to simulate different control strategies (annual density control, continuous density control, and rodent vaccination). For the field study, rodenticide baits were placed each year in three rural villages, while three other villages were used as controls. Rodents were trapped before and after every treatment and their antibody status and age were determined. Data from the field study were used to parameterize the mathematical model. In the field study, we found a significant negative effect of rodent control on seroprevalence, but this effect was small especially given the effort. Furthermore, the rodent populations recovered rapidly after rodenticide application, leading us to conclude that an annual control strategy is unlikely to significantly reduce Lassa virus spillover to humans. In agreement with this finding, the mathematical model suggests that the use of continuous control or rodent vaccination is the only strategy that could lead to Lassa virus elimination. These field and model results can serve as a guide for determining how long and frequent rodent control should be done in order to eliminate Lassa virus in rural villages.},

  Abstract = {Usutu virus (USUV) is a Culex-associated mosquito-borne flavivirus of the Flaviviridae family. Since its discovery in 1959, the virus has been isolated from birds, arthropods and humans in Europe and Africa. An increasing number of Usutu virus infections in humans with neurological presentations have been reported. Recently, the virus has been detected in bats and horses, which deviates from the currently proposed enzootic cycle of USUV involving several different avian and mosquito species. Despite this increasing number of viral detections in different mammalian hosts, the existence of a non-avian reservoir remains unresolved. In Kedougou, a tropical region in the southeast corner of Senegal, Usutu virus was detected, isolated and sequenced from five asymptomatic small mammals: Two different rodent species and a single species of shrew. Additional molecular characterization and in vivo growth dynamics showed that these rodents/shrew-derived viruses are closely related to the reference strain (accession number: AF013412) and are as pathogenic as other characterized strains associated with neurological invasions in human. This is the first evidence of Usutu virus isolation from rodents or shrews. Our findings emphasize the need to consider a closer monitoring of terrestrial small mammals in future active surveillance, public health, and epidemiological efforts in response to USUV in both Africa and Europe.},

  Volume = {49},

  Issn = {1879-0135},
  Abstract = {Commensal rodent species are key reservoirs for Toxoplasma gondii in the domestic environment. In rodents, different T. gondii strains show variable patterns of virulence according to host species. Toxoplasma gondii strains causing non-lethal chronic infections in local hosts will be more likely to persist in a given environment, but few studies have addressed the possible role of these interactions in shaping the T. gondii population structure. In addition, the absence of validated techniques for upstream detection of T. gondii chronic infection in wild rodents hinders exploration of this issue under natural conditions. In this study, we took advantage of an extensive survey of commensal small mammals in three coastal localities of Senegal, with a species assemblage constituted of both native African species and invasive species. We tested 828 individuals for T. gondii chronic infection using the modified agglutination test for antibody detection in serum samples and a quantitative PCR assay for detection of T. gondii DNA in brain samples. The infecting T. gondii strains were genotyped whenever possible by the analysis of 15 microsatellite markers. We found (i) a very poor concordance between molecular detection and serology in the invasive house mouse, (ii) significantly different levels of prevalence by species and (iii) the autochthonous T. gondii Africa 1 lineage strains, which are lethal for laboratory mice, only in the native African species of commensal small mammals. Overall, this study highlights the need to reconsider the use of MAT serology in natural populations of house mice and provides the first known data about T. gondii genetic diversity in invasive and native species of small mammals from Africa. In light of these results, we discuss the role of invasive and native species, with their variable adaptations to different T. gondii strains, in shaping the spatial structure of T. gondii genetic diversity in Africa.

We surveyed wild small mammal populations in the areas of Richard Toll and Lake Guiers, Senegal, with the objective to evaluate their potential role as intermediate hosts of larval taeniid stages (i.e. metacestodes). Based on genetic sequences of a segment of the mitochondrial DNA gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI), we identified Hydatigera parva metacestodes in 19 out of 172 (11.0\%) Hubert's multimammate mice (Mastomys huberti) and one out of six (16.7\%) gerbils (Taterillus sp.) and Hydatigera taeniaeformis sensu stricto metacestodes in one out of 215 (0.5\%) Nile rats (Arvicanthis niloticus). This study reports epidemiological and molecular information on H. parva and H. taeniaeformis in West African rodents, further supporting the phylogeographic hypothesis on the African origin of H. parva. Our findings may indicate significant trophic interactions contributing to the local transmission of Hydatigera spp. and other parasites with similar life-cycle mechanisms. We therefore propose that further field investigations of rodent population dynamics and rodent-borne infectious organisms are necessary to improve our understanding of host-parasite associations driving the transmission risks of rodent parasites in West Africa.},

  Abstract = {Changes in host-parasite ecological interactions during biological invasion events may affect both the outcome of invasions and the dynamics of exotic and/or endemic infections. We tested these hypotheses, by investigating ongoing house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) and black rat (Rattus rattus) invasions in Senegal (West Africa). We used a 16S gene rRNA amplicon sequencing approach to study potentially zoonotic bacterial communities in invasive and native rodents sampled along two well-defined independent invasion routes. We found that individual host factors (body mass and sex) were important drivers of these bacterial infections in rodents. We observed that the bacterial communities varied along invasion routes and differed between invasive and native rodents, with native rodents displaying higher overall bacterial diversity than invasive rodents. Differences in prevalence levels for some bacterial Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) provided support for ecological processes connecting parasitism and invasion success. Finally, our results indicated that rodent invasions may lead to the introduction of exotic bacterial genera and/or to changes in the prevalence of endemic ones. This study illustrates the difficulty of predicting the relationship between biodiversity and disease risks, and advocate for public health prevention strategies based on global pathogen surveillance followed by accurate characterization of potential zoonotic agents.},

Such a situation makes pathogen detection in rodent populations important, especially in the context of developing countries characterized by high infectious disease burden. Here, we used indirect fluorescent antibody tests to describe the circulation of potentially zoonotic viruses in both invasive (Mus musculus domesticus and Rattus rattus) and native (Mastomys erythroleucus and Mastomys natalensis) murine rodent populations in Senegal (West Africa). Of the 672 rodents tested, we reported 22 seropositive tests for Hantavirus, Orthopoxvirus, and Mammarenavirus genera, and no evidence of viral coinfection. This study is the first to report serological detection of Orthopoxvirus in rodents from Senegal, Mammarenavirus in R. rattus from Africa, and Hantavirus in M. m. domesticus and in M. erythroleucus. Further specific identification of the viral agents highlighted here is urgently needed for crucial public health concerns.},

  Abstract = {Knowledge of the genetic make-up and demographic history of invasive populations is critical to understand invasion mechanisms. Commensal rodents are ideal models to study whether complex invasion histories are typical of introductions involving human activities. The house mouse Mus musculus domesticus is a major invasive synanthropic rodent originating from South-West Asia. It has been largely studied in Europe and on several remote islands, but the genetic structure and invasion history of this taxon have been little investigated in several continental areas, including West Africa. In this study, we focussed on invasive populations of M. m. domesticus in Senegal. In this focal area for European settlers, the distribution area and invasion spread of the house mouse is documented by decades of data on commensal rodent communities. Genetic variation at one mitochondrial locus and 16 nuclear microsatellite markers was analysed from individuals sampled in 36 sites distributed across the country. A combination of phylogeographic and population genetics methods showed that there was a single introduction event on the northern coast of Senegal, from an exogenous (probably West European) source, followed by a secondary introduction from northern Senegal into a coastal site further south. The geographic locations of these introduction sites were consistent with the colonial history of Senegal. Overall, the marked microsatellite genetic structure observed in Senegal, even between sites located close together, revealed a complex interplay of different demographic processes occurring during house mouse spatial expansion, including sequential founder effects and stratified dispersal due to human transport along major roads.},

We found evidence that LASV is also hosted by other rodent species: the African wood mouse Hylomyscus pamfi in Nigeria, and the Guinea multimammate mouse Mastomys erythroleucus in both Nigeria and Guinea. Virus strains from these animals were isolated in the BSL-4 laboratory and fully sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses of viral genes coding for glycoprotein, nucleoprotein, polymerase and matrix protein show that Lassa strains detected in M. erythroleucus belong to lineages III and IV. The strain from H. pamfi clusters close to lineage I (for S gene) and between II \&III (for L gene).

  Abstract = {Although several studies have associated Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU) infection, Buruli ulcer (BU), with slow moving water bodies, there is still no definite mode of transmission. Ecological and transmission studies suggest Variable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR) typing as a useful tool to differentiate MU strains from other Mycolactone Producing Mycobacteria (MPM). Deciphering the genetic relatedness of clinical and environmental isolates is seminal to determining reservoirs, vectors and transmission routes. In this study, we attempted to source-track MU infections to specific water bodies by matching VNTR profiles of MU in human samples to those in the environment. Environmental samples were collected from 10 water bodies in four BU endemic communities in the Ashanti region, Ghana. Four VNTR loci in MU Agy99 genome, were used to genotype environmental MU ecovars, and those from 14 confirmed BU patients within the same study area. Length polymorphism was confirmed with sequencing. MU was present in the 3 different types of water bodies, but significantly higher in biofilm samples. Four MU genotypes, designated W, X, Y and Z, were typed in both human and environmental samples. Other reported genotypes were only found in water bodies. Animal trapping identified 1 mouse with lesion characteristic of BU, which was confirmed as MU infection. Our findings suggest that patients may have been infected from community associated water bodies. Further, we present evidence that small mammals within endemic communities could be susceptible to MU infections. M. ulcerans transmission could involve several routes where humans have contact with risk environments, which may be further compounded by water bodies acting as vehicles for disseminating strains.},

  Abstract = {Leptospirosis essentially affects human following contact with rodent urine-contaminated water. As such, it was mainly found associated with rice culture, recreational activities and flooding. This is also the reason why it has mainly been investigated in temperate as well as warm and humid regions, while arid zones have been only very occasionally monitored for this disease. In particular, data for West African countries are extremely scarce. Here, we took advantage of an extensive survey of urban rodents in Niamey, Niger, in order to look for rodent-borne pathogenic Leptospira species presence and distribution across the city. To do so, we used high throughput bacterial 16S-based metabarcoding, lipL32 gene-targeting RT-PCR, rrs gene sequencing and VNTR typing as well as GIS-based multivariate spatial analysis. Our results show that leptospires seem absent from the core city where usual Leptospira reservoir rodent species (namely R. rattus and M. natalensis) are yet abundant. On the contrary, L. kirschneri was detected in Arvicanthis niloticus and Cricetomys gambianus, two rodent species that are restricted to irrigated cultures within the city. Moreover, the VNTR profiles showed that rodent-borne leptospires in Niamey belong to previously undescribed serovars. Altogether, our study points towards the importance of market gardening in maintain and circulation of leptospirosis within Sahelian cities. In Africa, irrigated urban agriculture constitutes a pivotal source of food supply, especially in the context of the ongoing extensive urbanization of the continent. With this in mind, we speculate that leptospirosis may represent a zoonotic disease of concern also in arid regions that would deserve to be more rigorously surveyed, especially in urban agricultural settings.},

  Abstract = {Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) is a zoonotic disease caused by several Borrelia species transmitted to humans by Ornithodoros tick vectors. In West Africa, Borrelia crocidurae is a common cause of disease in many rural populations. Small mammals act as reservoirs of infection. We report here the results of surveys that investigated the occurrence of B. crocidurae infection in rodents and insectivores from eight countries of West and Central Africa. Animals were identified at the species level and tested for Borrelia either by examination of thick blood film, intra-peritoneal inoculation of blood or brain tissues into laboratory mice, or by molecular techniques. A total of 4358 small mammals belonging to 38 species and 7 families were collected, including 3225 specimens collected in areas where the occurrence of Ornithodoros sonrai tick in rodent burrows was documented, and 1133 in areas where this tick was absent. In areas with O. sonrai, Borrelia infection was demonstrated in 287 of 3109 (9.2\%) small mammals tested, and none was documented in 1004 animals tested from other areas. There was no relationship between the occurrence of Rhipicephalus, Hyaloma and Argas ticks in burrows and the distribution of Borrelia infection in small mammals. The 287 specimens infected by Borrelia belonged to 15 rodent and shrew species, including three Saharo-Sahelian species - Gerbillus gerbillus, Gerbillus occiduus and Gerbillus tarabuli - identified as reservoirs for TBRF with a distribution restricted to this area. In Sudan and Sudano-Sahelian areas, Arvicanthis niloticus, Mastomys erythroleucus and Mastomys huberti were the main reservoir of infection. Although most small mammals species collected had a large distribution in West and Central Africa, the fact that only animals collected in areas with O. sonrai were found infected suggest that this tick is the only vector of TBRF in rodents and insectivores in this part of Africa.

Between 2009 and 2013, 108 black rats (Rattus rattus) and 77 mice (Mus musculus) were analysed for the presence of Coxiella and Toxoplasma antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect immunofluorescence (IFA), respectively. Our results showed a wide distribution of C. burnetii and T. gondii, except for T. gondii in Cape Verde, in both rodent species. The overall seroprevalence of C. burnetii antibodies was 12.4\%; 21.1\% for Cape Verde and 10.2\% for the Canary Islands. With respect to T. gondii, seropositive rodents were only observed in the Canary Islands, with an overall seroprevalence of 15\%. Considering the fact that both pathogens can infect a large range of hosts, including livestock and humans, the results are of public health and veterinary importance and could be used by governmental entities to manage risk factors and to prevent future cases of Q fever and toxoplasmosis.},

Here, we provide results of an extensive survey of urban rodents conducted in Niamey, Niger, depicting the early stages of rodent bioinvasions within a city. We explore the species-specific spatial distributions throughout the city using contrasted approaches, namely field sampling, co-occurrence analysis, occupancy modelling and indicator geostatistics. We show that (i) two species (i.e. rural-like vs. truly commensal) assemblages can be identified, and that (ii) within commensal rodents, invasive (Rattus rattus and Mus musculus) and native (Mastomys natalensis) species are spatially segregated. Moreover, several pieces of arguments tend to suggest that these exclusive distributions reflect an ongoing native-to-invasive species turn over. The underlying processes as well as the possible consequences for humans are discussed.},

  Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bartonellae are fastidious bacteria causing persistent bacteremia in humans and a wide variety of animals. In recent years there is an increasing interest in mammalian bartonelloses in general and in rodent bartonelloses in particular. To date, no studies investigating the presence of Bartonella spp. in rodents and ectoparasites from Nigeria were carried out., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The aim of the current study was to investigate the presence of Bartonella spp. in commensal rodents and their ectoparasites in Nigeria. We report, for the first time, the molecular detection of Bartonella in 26\% (46/177) of commensal rodents (Rattus rattus, R. norvegicus and Cricetomys gambianus) and 28\% (9/32) of ectoparasite pools (Xenopsylla cheopis, Haemolaelaps spp., Ctenophthalmus spp., Hemimerus talpoides, and Rhipicephalus sanguineus) from Nigeria. Sequence analysis of the citrate synthase gene (gltA) revealed diversity of Bartonella spp. and genotypes in Nigerian rodents and their ectoparasites. Bartonella spp. identical or closely related to Bartonella elizabethae, Bartonella tribocorum and Bartonella grahamii were detected., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: High prevalence of infection with Bartonella spp. was detected in commensal rodents and ectoparasites from Nigeria. The Bartonella spp. identified were previously associated with human diseases highlighting their importance to public health. Further studies need to be conducted to determine whether the identified Bartonella species could be responsible for human cases of febrile illness in Nigeria.},

  Abstract = {An understanding of the evolutionary history and dynamics of invasive species is required for the construction of predictive models of future spread and the design of biological management measures. The black rat (Rattus rattus) is a major vertebrate invader with a worldwide distribution. Despite the severe ecological, economic and health impacts of this species, its evolutionary history has been little studied. We carried out extensive specimen sampling in Senegal, West Africa, and used microsatellite markers to describe the pattern and processes of invasion in this large continental area. The genetic data obtained were combined with historical knowledge concerning the presence of this species in Senegal. Data were analysed by a combination of Bayesian clustering and approximate Bayesian computation methods. The invasion pathways closely paralleled the history of human trade routes in Senegal. In several places, we detected the occurrence of multiple introductions from genetically different sources. Long-distance migration between towns and villages was also observed. Our findings suggest that genetic bottlenecks and admixture have played a major role in shaping the genetics of invasive black rats. These two processes may generate genetic novelty and favour rapid evolution along the invasion pathways. Copyright  2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tick-borne relapsing fever spirochetes are maintained in endemic foci that involve a diversity of small mammals and argasid ticks in the genus Ornithodoros. Most epidemiological studies of tick-borne relapsing fever in West Africa caused by Borrelia crocidurae have been conducted in Senegal. The risk for humans to acquire relapsing fever in Mali is uncertain, as only a few human cases have been identified. Given the high incidence of malaria in Mali, and the potential to confuse the clinical diagnosis of these two diseases, we initiated studies to determine if there were endemic foci of relapsing fever spirochetes that could pose a risk for human infection., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated 20 villages across southern Mali for the presence of relapsing fever spirochetes. Small mammals were captured, thin blood smears were examined microscopically for spirochetes, and serum samples were tested for antibodies to relapsing fever spirochetes. Ornithodoros sonrai ticks were collected and examined for spirochetal infection. In total, 11.0\% of the 663 rodents and 14.3\% of the 63 shrews tested were seropositive and 2.2\% of the animals had active spirochete infections when captured. In the Bandiagara region, the prevalence of infection was higher with 35\% of the animals seropositive and 10\% infected. Here also Ornithodoros sonrai were abundant and 17.3\% of 278 individual ticks tested were infected with Borrelia crocidurae. Fifteen isolates of B. crocidurae were established and characterized by multi-locus sequence typing., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The potential for human tick-borne relapsing fever exists in many areas of southern Mali.},

  Abstract = {Invading rodent species can harbor parasites with potential transmission to native rodents and/or humans. To investigate trypanosomes prevalence in rodents, the spleen of 76 rodents from Niger identified by their karyotype was used as a DNA source for Trypanosoma detection using a newly developed qPCR assay. Of the invasive black rat, Rattus rattus, 71\% (10/14) were PCR positive as well as 6\% (4/62) of native African rodents. Sequences of {\textasciitilde}400bp of the SSU rDNA gene identified phylogenetically close Trypanosoma lineages. Trypanosoma lewisi was present in all positive black rats and the sequences displayed 100\% similarity with T. lewisi-infected humans in Senegal. T. lewisi was also detected in one Acomys johannis, suggesting a possible transmission to native species. In addition to improved knowledge of Trypanosoma diversity in rodents, our data underscore the introduction of the potentially pathogenic T. lewisi kinetoplastid through the human-mediated invasion of black rats all over West Africa.

Subsequent to the outbreak in the United States, 204 animals were collected from two commercial trapping sites in Ghana. Animal tissues were examined for the presence of orthopoxvirus (OPXV) DNA using a real-time polymerase chain reaction, and sera were assayed for antibodies against OPXV. Animals from five genera (Cricetomys, Graphiurus, Funiscirus, and Heliosciurus) had antibodies against OPXV, and three genera (Cricetomys, Graphiurus, and Xerus) had evidence of OPXV DNA in tissues. Additionally, 172 persons living near the trapping sites were interviewed regarding risk factors for OPXV exposure, and their sera were analyzed. Fifty-three percent had IgG against OPXV; none had IgM. Our findings suggest that several species of forest-dwelling rodents from Ghana are susceptible to naturally occurring OPXV infection, and that persons living near forests may have low-level or indirect exposure to OPXV-infected animals, possibly resulting in sub-clinical infections.},

  Abstract = {Rodents of the genus Mastomys form the reservoir for Lassa virus (LV), an arenavirus that causes a potentially severe hemorrhagic illness, Lassa fever (LF). Although Mastomys rodents exist throughout sub-Saharan Africa, areas of human LF appear to be quite focal. The distribution of small mammals and LV-infected Mastomys has been assessed in only a few countries. We conducted a survey of small mammals in selected regions of Guinea to assess the degree to which LV poses a public health risk in that country. A total of 1,616 small mammals, including 956 (59\%) Mastomys, were captured from 444 households and seven bush sites. Mastomys made up {\textgreater} 90\% of the captured animals in the savannah, savannah-forest transition, and forest regions of Guinea, while Mus musculus dominated in coastal and urban sites. Animals were analyzed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for LV-specific antigen (blood and spleen homogenate) and IgG antibody (blood only). Virus isolation from spleen homogenates was also performed on a subset of animals. Lassa antibody and antigen were found in 96 (11\%) and 46 (5\%), respectively, of 884 tested Mastomys. Antibody and antigen were essentially mutually exclusive and showed profiles consistent with vertical transmission of both LV and antibody. LV was isolated only from Mastomys. ELISA antigen constituted an acceptable surrogate for virus isolation, with a sensitivity and specificity when performed on blood of 78\% (95\% confidence interval: 68-83\%) and 98\% (95-99\%), respectively. The proportion of LV-infected Mastomys per region ranged from 0 to 9\% and was highest in the savannah and forest zones. The proportion of infected animals per village varied considerably, even between villages in close proximity. Infected animals tended to cluster in relatively few houses, suggesting the existence of focal "hot spots" of LV-infected Mastomys that may account for the observed heterogeneous distribution of LF.},

  Abstract = {More than 2000 animals belonging to six different rodent species and one insectivore species were examined for infection with schistosomes in the region of Richard-Toll, Senegal. Two murid rodents, Arvicanthis niloticus and Mastomys huberti, were found infected with Schistosoma mansoni. Prevalences were about 5\% for both rodent species with a mean worm burden of about 20 worms per host. The sex-ratios of S. mansoni worms were always biased towards males. Prevalences and worm burdens, although similar in both male and female rodents, increased significantly with age. The highest prevalences and worm burdens were found near habitations and decreased significantly with the distance from the town of Richard-Toll. Eggs were also observed in the liver and faeces of the two naturally infected rodent species. The results suggest that rodents participate in the transmission of intestinal schistosomiasis in Richard-Toll but the human population is the main source of infection. The genetic resemblance between human and murine isolates of S. mansoni suggests that further epidemiological studies are needed in this region of Senegal.},

Of the 82 rodents examined, the proportion of infected animals was respectively 2.4\%, 7.3\% and 14.6\% for each method, and 18.3\% for all 3 methods combined. Of the 12 animals with infected cerebral tissue, only 3 were found to have infected blood. These results suggest that isolated infections of the brain occur frequently in Senegalese wild rodents. Measurement of the real prevalence of B. crocidurae should therefore take into account these infections in addition to blood infections.},

  Abstract = {Reported cases of tick-borne relapsing fever due to the spirochaete Borrelia crocidurae are rare in West Africa, and few epidemiological data are available. To see how common relapsing fever is in Senegal thick blood smears from cases of fever of unknown origin and from randomly selected clinic outpatients from a rural dispensary were examined for Borrelia. The prevalence of Borrelia infections in small mammals was also assessed. Borrelia was seen in smears of 12 (0.9\%) of 1340 children. All children who tested positive had complained of acute fever. Prevalence was 0\% (0/496), 0.5\% (2/417), 1.6\% (5/308), and 4.2\% (5/119) at ages 0-1, 2-4, 5-9, and 10-14, respectively. 26 other instances of borreliosis were seen in patients from different regions of Senegal. Blood samples from 7 of these patients were inoculated intraperitoneally into white mice; serious infection developed in all mice. Borrelia was seen in thick smears from 65 of 461 wild rodents or insectivores. Six rodents species were infected. From a sample of 93 rodents, 33.3\% were infected, as judged by intraperitoneal inoculation of white mice, compared with 14.1\% by direct smear examination. The findings suggest that borreliosis has a wide distribution and a high incidence in Senegal. This disease may be a major cause of morbidity in rural areas throughout much of West Africa.},

All 32-chromosome animals exhibited a single hemoglobin pattern, whereas those with 38-chromosomes had four distinguishable patterns. Both karyotypes were present throughout Sierra Leone. The 38-chromosome species was more prevalent in the Guinea savanna zone to the north, while the 32-chromosome species was most dominant in human-modified high forest areas of the eastern and southern parts of the country. In almost all situations the 32-chromosome species was more common in houses than in bush habitats; the reverse was true for Mastomys having 38 chromosomes. Analysis of hemoglobin patterns thus becomes useful for species identification, and is necessary to understand the roles of the different Mastomys forms as reservoirs of human diseases, such as Lassa fever in West Africa.},

  Abstract = {Rodents were trapped in the Benue-Plateau and North-Eastern States of Nigeria where Lassa fever had been reported in previous years. Eight Lassa virus strains were isolated from tissues and blood of rodents identified in the field as being of 3 different species: Mastomys natalensis, Rattus rattus, and Mus minutoides. All the infected rodents were collected in village habitats. These isolations indicate the presence of Lassa virus in wild rodents in Nigeria during periods when no human infections were evident.Prior studies in Sierra Leone have indicated that a single rodent species, M. natalensis, may be the important reservoir host of Lassa virus. Since the present study indicates that other rodent species may be involved as well, the ecology of Lassa virus may be more complicated than was heretofore supposed. In view of the importance of determining the geographic and species range of rodent hosts of Lassa virus, and because of the problems inherent in rodent identification under austere field conditions, it is urgent that further studies be conducted in the same areas of Nigeria to confirm these findings.},

During an epidemic in Sierra Leone, Lassa virus was isolated for the first time from wild rodents of Mastomys natalensis. A high prevalence of infected Mastomys was found in houses occupied by patients with Lassa fever. The data presented provide the first demonstration of an extra-human cycle of Lassa virus transmission and suggest that rodent control may be an effective method of limiting the disease.},

  Volume = {10},

  Abstract = {Simple Summary Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus (LASV). It is a deadly rodent-borne zoonosis with outbreaks occurring mostly in Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Nigeria, in West Africa. In Sierra Leone, surveillance activities of LASV focus mainly on the Kenema area in the eastern region, known to be the epicentre. Little is known about the presence of the virus in the Bo area, where Mastomys natalensis and Rattus rattus share habitats with humans. Our study investigated the circulation and phylogeny of new LASV strains and virus seroprevalence in rodent populations of villages in Bo district. Information provided here will be of great importance in prioritizing areas for Lassa fever surveillance and preventive measures to mitigate future outbreaks. Our rodent longitudinal survey carried out over two years (2014-2016) identified Mastomys natalensis as the most prevalent species. While seropositive small mammals were found in every village, the four Mastomys natalensis rodents that tested PCR-positive for Lassa virus were found in only two villages. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these sequences belong to the Sierra Leonean clade, within lineage IV. In conclusion, LASV is present, with low circulation, in small mammals in rural settings around Bo. Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus LASV, which was first isolated in the rodent Mastomys natalensis in 1974 in Kenema, Sierra Leone. As little is known about the abundance and the presence of LASV in rodents living in the Bo area, we carried out a small mammal longitudinal population survey. A standardized trapping session was performed in various habitats and seasons in six villages over two years (2014-2016) and samples collected were tested for arenavirus IgG and LASV. A Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was performed on sequences identified by PCR. A total of 1490 small mammals were collected, and 16 rodent species were identified, with M. natalensis (355, 24\%) found to be the most prevalent species. Forty-one (2.8\%) samples were IgG positive, and 31 of these were trapped in homes and 10 in surrounding vegetation. Twenty-nine of 41 seropositive rodents were M. natalensis. We detected four LASV by PCR in two villages, all found in M. natalensis. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the sequences were distributed within the Sierra Leonean clade within lineage IV, distinguishing a Bo sub-clade older than a Kenema sub-clade. Compared to other settings, we found a low abundance of M. natalensis and a low circulation of LASV in rodents in villages around Bo district.},

  Abstract = {Rodents are known to be reservoir hosts for at least 60 zoonotic diseases and are known to play an important role in their transmission and spread in different ways. We sampled different rodent communities within and around human settlements in Northern Senegal, an area subjected to major environmental transformations associated with global changes. Herein, we conducted an epidemiological study on their bacterial communities. One hundred and seventy-one (171) invasive and native rodents were captured, 50 from outdoor trapping sites and 121 rodents from indoor habitats, consisting of five species. The DNA of thirteen pathogens was successfully screened on the rodents' spleens. We found: 2.3\% of spleens positive to Piroplasmida and amplified one which gave a potentially new species Candidatus Theileria senegalensis ; 9.35\% of Bartonella spp. and amplified 10, giving three genotypes; 3.5\% of filariasis species; 18.12\% of Anaplasmataceae species and amplified only 5, giving a new potential species Candidatus Ehrlichia senegalensis ; 2.33\% of Hepatozoon spp.; 3.5\% of Kinetoplastidae spp.; and 15.2\% of Borrelia spp. and amplified 8 belonging all to Borrelia crocidurae. Some of the species of pathogens carried by the rodents of our studied area may be unknown because most of those we have identified are new species. In one bacterial taxon, Anaplasma, a positive correlation between host body mass and infection was found. Overall, male and invasive rodents appeared less infected than female and native ones, respectively.},

  Abstract = {Tanoe-Ehy Swamp Forest (TESF) is one of the most valuable conservation sites in Ivory Coast. It harbours an exceptional biodiversity with numerous endangered plants and animals. Indeed, several recent studies have been carried out in TESF to consolidate judgment of its importance for conservation in Ivory Coast. These investigations have mentioned the presence of threatened monkeys and frogs. Currently, small mammals of the TESF remain unknown despite the consensus around their importance in natural biotopes. Yet small terrestrial mammals are known to be good indicators of the conservation status of many tropical ecosystems. This study is a preliminary exploration of terrestrial small mammal communities in the Tanoe-Ehy Swamp Forest. It aims to determine species composition and reveal their implication in the conservation of the Tanoe-Ehy Swamp Forest. Thus, the three main habitat types (dryland forests, swamp forests and raphials (Raphia-dominated community)) were sampled using conventional Sherman and Victor wooden snap traps. With a trapping effort of 8400 trap nights, 294 individuals, representing nine species of rodents and four species of shrews were collected. The rodent community was dominated by Hylomyscus simus (n = 135), followed by Praomys rostratus (n = 65) and Malacomys edwardsi (n = 18). Crocidura buettikoferi (n = 22) was the most abundant shrew. The species richness and diversity index were higher in drylands than in swamp forests and raphials. Swamp forests showed the highest number of trapped animals (n = 126), followed by the dryland forests (n = 107) and the raphials with 63 individuals. One-way ANOVA test revealed significant differences (p {\textless}= 0.05) between the abundance of terrestrial small mammals of the three sampled habitat types. Similarity indices showed that dryland and swamp forests were largely colonised by the same species. Three species are listed as threatened according to the criteria of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Those are one rodent, Hylomyscus baeri, listed as Endangered (EN), and two shrews, Crocidura buettikoferi and Crocidura grandiceps, which are both Near Threatened (NT). This study reinforces the importance of TESF for fauna conservation in Ivory Coast.},

  Abstract = {Based on compiled small mammal trapping data collected over 12 years from Benin and Niger (3701 individual records from 66 sampling sites), located in mainland Africa, we here describe the small mammal community assemblage in urban habitats along the commercial axis connecting the two countries, from the seaport of Cotonou to the Sahelian hinterland, with a particular focus on invasive species. In doing so, we document extant species distributions, which highlight the risks of continuing the range expansion of three synanthropic invasive rodent species, namely black rats (Rattus rattus), brown rats (R. norvegicus), and house mice (Mus musculus). Using various diversity estimates and community ecology approaches, we detect a latitudinal gradient of species richness that significantly decreased Northward. We show that shrews (Crocidura) represent a very important component of micro-mammal fauna in West African towns and villages, especially at lower latitudes. We also demonstrate that invasive and native synanthropic rodents do not distribute randomly in West Africa, which suggests that invasive species dynamics and history differ markedly, and that they involve gradual, as well as human-mediated, long distance dispersal. Patterns of segregation are also observed between native Mastomys natalensis and invasive rats R. rattus and R. norvegicus, suggesting potential native-to-invasive species turn over. Consequences of such processes, especially in terms of public health, are discussed.},

  Abstract = {Urbanization is a key driver of global biodiversity loss. Although sub-Saharan African countries are experiencing unprecedented urbanization and urban expansion, very little is known about how this impacts tropical biodiversity. Here, we assessed the effects of urban expansion and urban green space on local small mammal species diversity in Accra, Ghana. We surveyed small mammals in the University of Ghana botanical garden, an urban green area (UGA) and adjoining built-up environment (BE) and compared the results with baseline data (BLD) collected when large areas of the current city still remained mostly undeveloped. The methodology involved live-trapping using Sherman collapsible live-traps. Our data showed higher small mammal abundance and diversity in the UGA than BE. Similarity of species composition was higher between UGA and BLD than between BE and BLD. The small mammal species captured in BE (the rodents Mastomys erythroleucus, Rattus rattus, and Arvicanthis rufinus, and the shrew Crocidura olivieri) are known to easily adapt to human-modified landscapes. Our results suggest that urbanization negatively influenced the abundance, diversity, and community composition of small mammals. Efforts should be directed towards the integration of urban green areas into urban land development planning in developing countries in order to conserve local wildlife and ecological services that enhance the quality of urban life.},

  Abstract = {High-risk ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) have been described in wild birds and rodents worldwide. Rats are of special interest not only due to their indicator role for environmental pollution with multi-resistant bacteria but also as possible infection source. Data on the presence of high-risk ESBL-E in urban wildlife from Africa remain scarce, however. Twenty-nine animals from three different rat (Rattus) species were captured in the city of Conakry (Guinea, West Africa) in 2015. Rectal swabs were analyzed for ESBL-E using selective media. Species typing and phenotypic antimicrobial resistance analysis to broad-spectrum beta-lactams and other classes of antimicrobials was performed for Enterobacteriaceae-like isolates using the VITEK (R) 2 system (BioMerieux, Germany). Confirmed ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae were whole-genome sequenced and resistance genes, phylogenetic background and genes related to bacterial fitness and virulence were analyzed. In total, six of twenty-nine rats (20\%) carried ESBL-E (K. pneumoniae and E. coli). All ESBL-producers were multi-drug resistant with blaCTX-M-15 as the dominating ESBL-type. Interestingly, ESBL-associated clonal lineages E. coli ST38 and K. pneumoniae ST307 were found. The ESBL-plasmid in K. pneumoniae ST307 revealed high sequence similarities to pKPN3-307\_TypeC, a {\textgreater} 200 kbp IncFII plasmid originating from a human clinical ST307 isolate. This was in contrast to the core genome: the rat isolate was distantly related to the human clinical ST307 isolate (27 SNPs/Mbp). In addition, we identified p -fimbrial, capsule 2, and glycogen synthesis clusters in the rodent ST307 isolate, whose involvement in the adaptation to survival outside the host and in human urinary tracts has been suggested. Our results demonstrate the presence of clinically relevant, ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae ST307 and E. coli ST38 clonal lineages in an urban West African rat population. The human community is likely the initial source of ESBL-E however, rats might function as infection source and transmission hub, accelerated by frequent interactions at a human-wildlife interface.},

  Volume = {75},
  Year = {2011},
  Issn = {0140-1963},
  Abstract = {Following the southward shift of rainfall isolines in the Sahel at the end of the 1960s. Gerbillus nigeriae appeared in northern Senegal in the mid-1990s, and two resident Gerbillidae (Taterillus pygargus and Taterillus gracilis) subsequently declined. We investigated the causal role of the capacity to conserve water in such climate-related shifts in the distribution of these Gerbillidae by comparing the effects of a water-poor diet on the water-efflux rate (W-out) of freshly trapped adults pre-acclimatized to a water-rich diet. During the 12-day period of water restriction in all species, 30-50\% of individuals became hyperactive and showed greater weight loss and higher W-out than the remaining inactive individuals. Such emergence of migratory strategists within populations could accelerate the expansion of G. nigeriae. On a water-poor diet, T. gracilis showed a lower capacity to conserve water (higher W-out) than T. pygargus and G. nigeriae, in both inactive (W-out = 44.5 +/- 1.8 vs 29.6 +/- 0.8 vs 27.4 +/- 0.7 ml kg(-0.82).day(-1), respectively) and hyperactive individuals (W-out = 60.4 +/- 1 vs 45.4 +/- 0.7 vs 44 +/- 0.8 ml kg(-0.82).day(-1), respectively). We propose that the capacity to conserve water accounted for both expansion of G. nigeriae and decline of T. gracilis, whereas competition between T. pygargus and G. nigeriae could account for the decline of T. pygargus.

During 2003 through 2005, 1,228 small mammals representing 14 different genera were trapped in 9 villages in south, east, and middle west of Cote d'Ivoire. Specimens were screened by pan-Old World arenavirus RT-PCRs targeting S and L RNA segments as well as immunofluorescence assay. Sequences of two novel tentative species of the family Arenaviridae, Menekre and Gbagroube virus, were detected in Hylomyscus sp. and Mus (Nannomys) setulosus, respectively. Arenavirus infection of Mus (Nannomys) setulosus was also demonstrated by serological testing. Lassa virus was not found, although 60\% of the captured animals were Mastomys natalensis. Complete S RNA and partial L RNA sequences of the novel viruses were recovered from the rodent specimens and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. Gbagroube virus is a closely related sister taxon of Lassa virus, while Menekre virus clusters with the Ippy/Mobala/Mopeia virus complex. Reconstruction of possible virus-host co-phylogeny scenarios suggests that, within the African continent, signatures of co-evolution might have been obliterated by multiple host-switching events.},

  Abstract = {The small mammal community of a coastal site of southwestern Mauritania was monitored using live trapping, owl pellet analysis and nocturnal visual censuses. Ten species of rodents and two shrews were recorded. Gerbillid rodents (Gerbillus nanus, G. gerbillus, G. tarabidi, G. nigeriae and Taterillus arenarius) were the most prevalent in traps, whereas a relatively large proportion of owl pellets were made up of a murid rodent, Mastomys huberti. The presence of two species of murids (M. huberti and Arvicanthis niloticus) in this presaharian environment is made possible by the presence of small patches of green vegetation associated with localized fresh water inputs. The contradiction of results from the sampling methods indicate potential biases in the determination of community composition and relative species abundance. Results are also discussed in estimating the potential role of predation and competition in this small mammal community.},
