nayak_quantification_2001,ANALYST,Quantification and validation of enzyme immunoassay for urinary aflatoxin {B}-1-{N}-7-guanine adduct for biological monitoring of aflatoxins,"The aflatoxin B-1-N-7-guanine (AFB(1)-N-7-guanine) adduct has been established as one of the relevant biomarkers of dietary aflatoxin (AFB(1)) exposure. Measurement of this adduct is potentially a useful dosimeter in molecular epidemiological studies. This paper reports the application and evaluation of a sensitive indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection and quantification of urinary AFB(1)-N-7-guanine adduct in high risk populations exposed to dietary aflatoxin. Earlier, we had reported a simple and rapid indirect ELISA method for AFB(1)-N-7-guanine adduct in the urine and liver tissues using polyclonal antibodies specific to AFB(1)-N-7-guanine adduct. The method was evaluated using a rodent model (Fischer 344), exposed to 1 mg kg(-1) body mass of AFB(1) and human urine samples obtained from a maize eating population, environmentally exposed to AFB(1) through their diet. The levels of AFB(1)-N-7-guanine adduct in rat and human urine ranged from 6.42 to 20.16 mug mg(-1) creatinine and from 9.30 to 13.43 ng mg(-1) creatinine, respectively. The level of AFB(1) in the diet as estimated by ELISA ranged from 1000 to 3600 ng d(-1). The interesting observation in these studies is that the females (in both rodents and human subjects) are more efficient than males at excreting the adduct. Total adduct (DNA bound adduct and guanine adduct excreted in urine) was found to be similar in male and female rats. However, 63\% of the total adduct was accounted for in urine of female rats, whereas male rats excreted 47\% of the total adduct in their urine. The present method may find wide application as a biochemical tool in molecular epidemiological studies with respect to human exposure to dietary aflatoxins.",0003-2654,NA,10.1039/b005778i
yates_auditory_2014,AUDIOLOGY AND NEURO-OTOLOGY,"Auditory {Brainstem} {Responses} of {Ephrin}-{A2}(-/-), {Ephrin}-{A5}(-/-) and {Ephrin}-{A2A5}(-/-) {Mice","Eph receptors and ephrin ligands are large families of cell surface proteins which have established roles in axonal growth and guidance. These are well characterized in the visual and somatosensory systems but are less well documented in the auditory pathway. We examined the possible functional role of two ephrin genes (ephrin-A2 and ephrinA5) in the auditory system by measuring auditory brainstem responses (ABR) to tone bursts from 6 to 30 kHz in ephrinA2 (-/-), ephrin-A5(-/-) and ephrin-A2A5(-/-) (knockout) mice. At high frequencies, the ephrin-A2A5(-/-) mice exhibited thresholds that were significantly lower than in wild-type mice by approximately 20 dB, suggesting ephrin-A2 and ephrin-A5 may have frequency-specific effects on the auditory system. There were also alterations in ABR wave peak amplitudes that were specific to each mouse strain which suggested both peripheral and central involvement of EphA-ephrin-A signalling in auditory function.

schofield_ascending_2002,JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY,Ascending and descending projections from the superior olivary complex in guinea pigs: {Different} cells project to the cochlear nucleus and the inferior colliculus,"The superior olivary complex is a source of ascending projections to the inferior colliculus and descending projections to the cochlear nucleus. We used multiple-labeling techniques with fluorescent retrograde tracers to determine whether individual superior olivary cells project to the inferior colliculus and the cochlear nucleus. Almost all labeled cells contained one tracer, suggesting that they projected to only one of the injected targets. A small number of cells sent collateral projections to the ipsilateral cochlear nucleus and ipsilateral inferior colliculus. The double-labeled cells constituted fewer than 2\% of the cells that projected to the cochlear nucleus or to the inferior colliculus. There was no evidence for cells projecting to both contralateral targets or to one ipsilateral target and one contralateral target. We conclude that the ascending projections to the inferior colliculus and the descending projections to the cochlear nucleus arise almost exclusively from separate populations of cells in the superior olivary complex. Their separate origins suggest that these projections are sending different information to higher and lower centers of the auditory pathways. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",0021-9967,NA,10.1002/cne.10402
imran_bioactivity-directed_2021,Journal of ethnopharmacology,"Bioactivity-directed evaluation of fruit of {Kigelia} africana ({Lam}.) benth. {Used} in treatment of malaria in {Iwo}, {Nigeria}.","ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The ancient people of Iwo communities consisting of Ile-Ogbo, Olupona, Iwo and Ogbagba continue to engage in the traditional use of medicinal plants for the treatment and management of common diseases especially malaria., AIMS OF THIS STUDY: This study conducted an ethnomedicinal survey of plants used to treat malaria and feverish conditions by the people of Iwo, Nigeria. It also evaluated the antiplasmodial activity of the morphological parts of Kigelia africana (Lam.) Benth., and isolated, as well as characterised pure compounds from the semi-purified fractions of the fruit extract., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ethnomedicinal survey was conducted using semi-structured questionnaires administered to only herb sellers in Iwo, Ile-Ogbo, Olupona, and Ogbagba areas of Osun State. Extracts of K. africana morphological parts; leaf, root, stem bark, and fruit were obtained by cold maceration in methanol, followed by assessment of acute toxicity (LD50) and antiplasmodial activity in Plasmodium berghei infected rats using the 4-day suppressive test model. The most active fruit extract was further subjected to activity-guided fractionation and purification using n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate (EtOAc), n-butanol (n-BuOH), and methanol (MeOH) in gradients to obtain the semi-purified fractions and two pure isolated compounds using various chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques., RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: From the survey, thirty-one plant species were identified for treating malaria in Iwo area. Azadirachta indica leaf was the most frequently used (78.3\% of the respondents) while Manihot esculenta leaf (3.33\%) was the least. The identified plants are distributed among 24 families, with Anacardiaceae and Asteraceae (11.67\% each) been the most occurring families. Kigelia africana (Bignoniaceae) ranked the 6th position with 60\% frequency of occurrence. The LD50 values obtained for the extracts were greater than 5000 mg/kg (p.o). The chemo-suppression activity of the extracts at 125 mg/kg was in the order of stem bark (26.59\%), leaf (41.75\%), root (43.95\%), and fruit (54.54\%). The semi-purified methanol fraction of the fruit showed the most antiplasmodial activity with a percent chemo-suppression of 69.94 and yielded 4-(2,3-dihydroxypropoxy)-3,5-dihydroxy-5-methylfuran-2-one and sucrose., CONCLUSION: The use of herbs and medicinal plants either singly or in combination for the treatment of malaria among the people of Iwo community in Nigeria is still well practised. Lack of formal education among most of the respondents and use of same local name for different plants species or plant parts; which often lead to wrong plant collection were among the constrains encountered. Kigelia africana has antiplasmodial activity in the order of fruit {\textgreater} root {\textgreater} leaf {\textgreater} stem bark. Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Transformation by these furocoumarins under the same activation conditions was also investigated in C3H/1OT1/2 cells. In V79 cells, AFB1 induced a 4-fold maximum mutation frequency over controls under BL activation at a concentration of 5 micrograms/ml; marmesin induced a 2-fold increased mutation frequency at 1.5 micrograms/ml; MOP induced a 19-fold increase at 10 micrograms/ml; chalepin induced a 3-fold increase at 5 micrograms/ml; and imperatorin induced a 20-fold increase at 10 micrograms/ml. Essentially no mutation was observed at the ouabain-resistant (Ouar) locus in C3H/1OT1/2 cells with any of these compounds. In the transformation assays, type II and type III foci were observed at a 1-microgram/ml addition of AFB1 with or without BL activation; while with MOP and imperatorin, these types of foci were observed only with BL activation. Marmesin, although relatively more cytotoxic than the other furocoumarins studied, with a 50\% lethal dose of less than 0.5 micrograms/ml, was not as mutagenic or potentially carcinogenic as were AFB1, imperatorin, or MOP with BL activation. These furocoumarins are considered to be involved in the etiology of the high incidence of skin cancer in Nigeria. Our experiments reinforce that concept and suggest that exposure to these furocoumarins may constitute a real carcinogenic hazard.",0008-5472,NA,NA
leski_sequence_2015-1,Emerging infectious diseases,"Sequence variability and geographic distribution of {Lassa} virus, {Sierra} {Leone}.","Lassa virus (LASV) is endemic to parts of West Africa and causes highly fatal hemorrhagic fever. The multimammate rat (Mastomys natalensis) is the only known reservoir of LASV. Most human infections result from zoonotic transmission. The very diverse LASV genome has 4 major lineages associated with different geographic locations. We used reverse transcription PCR and resequencing microarrays to detect LASV in 41 of 214 samples from rodents captured at 8 locations in Sierra Leone. Phylogenetic analysis of partial sequences of nucleoprotein (NP), glycoprotein precursor (GPC), and polymerase (L) genes showed 5 separate clades within lineage IV of LASV in this country. The sequence diversity was higher than previously observed; mean diversity was 7.01\% for nucleoprotein gene at the nucleotide level. These results may have major implications for designing diagnostic tests and therapeutic agents for LASV infections in Sierra Leone.",1080-6059,NA,10.3201/eid2104.141469

In this study cytosolic pH (pH(i)) was monitored in adult rat left ventricular myocytes loaded with the acetoxymethyl ester (AM form) of SNARF-1. A stable decrease in the pH(i) of 0.52 +/- 0.05 U (n = 16) was obtained by switching from a bicarbonate buffer equilibrated with 5\% CO2 to a buffer equilibrated with 20\% CO2. Electrical stimulation at either 0.5 or 1.5 Hz had no effect on pH(i) in 5\% CO2, nor did it affect the magnitude of pH(i) decrease in response to hypercarbic acidosis. Ca(i) was measured in myocytes loaded with indo-1/free acid and Ca(m) was monitored in cells loaded with indo-1/AM after quenching cytosolic indo-I fluorescence with MnCl2. In quiescent intact myocytes bathed in 1.5 mM [Ca2+], hypercarbia increased Ca(i) from 130 +/- 5 to 221 +/- 13 nM. However, when acidosis was effected in electrically stimulated myocytes, diastolic Ca(i) increased more than resting Ca(i) in quiescent myocytes, and during pacing at 1.5 Hz diastolic Ca(i) was higher (285 +/- 17 nM) than at 0.5 Hz (245 +/- 18 nM; P {\textless} 0.05). The magnitude of Ca(i) increase in quiescent myocytes was not affected either by sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ depletion with ryanodine or by SR Ca2+ depletion and concomitant superfusion with a Ca2+-free buffer. In unstimulated intact myocytes hypercarbia increased Ca(m) from 95 +/- 12 to 147 +/- 19 nM and this response was not modified either by ryanodine and a Ca2+-free buffer or by 50 muM ruthenium red in order to block the mitochondrial uniporter. In mitochondrial suspensions loaded either with BCECF/AM or indo-1/AM, acidosis produced by lactic acid addition decreased both intra- and extramitochondrial pH and increased Ca(m). Studies of mitochondrial suspensions bathed in indo-1/free acid-containing solution showed an increase in extramitochondrial Ca2+ after the addition of lactic acid. Thus, in quiescent myocytes, cytoplasmic and intramitochondrial buffers, rather than transsarcolemmal Ca2+ influx or SR Ca2+ release, are the likely Ca2+ sources for the increase in Ca(i) and Ca(m), respectively; additionally, Ca2+ efflux from the mitochondria may contribute to the raise in Ca(i). In contrast, in response to acidosis, diastolic Ca(i) in electrically stimulated myocytes increases more than resting Ca(i) in quiescent cells; this suggests that during pacing, net cell Ca2+ gain contributes to enhance diastolic Ca(i).",0022-1295,NA,10.1085/jgp.102.3.575
adu_patterns_2003,Tropical animal health and production,"Patterns of parturition and mortality in weaned greater cane rats ({Thryonomys} swinderianus, {Temminck}).","The patterns of parturition and mortality were studied in a colony of weaned captive greater cane rats, Thryonomys swinderianus, Temminck, from January to December 2000 at the Grasscutter Domestication Centre, Pokoase Research Station, Animal Research Institute, Ghana. The most important finding from the study was that it is practical to wean greater cane rats at 4 weeks of age with proper post-weaning management. Mortality ranged between 0 and 3.9\% with an average of 1.4\% for animals weaned at 4 weeks. Among the factors contributing to mortality in the weaned greater cane rats may be the number of animals per unit space. The mortality in this study was a marked improvement compared to that of 11\% reported elsewhere for animals weaned at 6 weeks. The animals were, however, smaller at weaning compared to those in reports from elsewhere, probably owing to poor lactation by the mothers. Peak parturition occurred in October with captive breeding having no influence on the parturition pattern.",0049-4747,NA,NA

One week after systemic infusion of TNF, the animals started to receive either five intramuscular injections of bacterial Lipopolysaccharide (LPS from Escherichia coli; 20 mu g/kg) or equivalent volumes of solvent (0.9\% NaCl) in intervals of 3 days. Fever in response to repeated injections of LPS was progressively attenuated; the animals developed endotoxin tolerance. Repeated injections with solvent did not cause any measurable changes in abdominal temperature. Three days after the fifth injection of LPS or solvent, all animals again received an intra-arterial infusion of 5 mu g/kg TNF. In guinea pigs injected five times with solvent, the biphasic elevation of abdominal temperature could again be observed in response to systemic infusions of TNF. In endotoxin-tolerant animals, however, only the first peak of the biphasic thermal response lasting similar to 60 min could be monitored after infusions with TNF. The second phase of the thermal response to administration of TNF, which normally lasts {\textgreater}5 h, was abrogated almost completely. The significant suppression of the febrile response to TNF infusions did not seem to be caused by a more rapid elimination of TNF from the circulation of endotoxin-tolerant guinea pigs. Circulating levels of TNF, measured 60 and 180 min after the start of TNF infusions, were not different before and after development of endotoxin tolerance. In conclusion, the development of endotoxin tolerance in guinea pigs is accompanied by a reduced responsiveness to TNF administered exogenously.",0363-6119,NA,NA

It is based on the optokinetic reflex which causes the animals to track a drifting stripe pattern with eye and head movements. We have developed an improved version of the optomotor test with better control over the stimulus parameters, as well as a high degree of automation. The stripe pattern is presented on computer monitors surrounding the animal. By tracking the head position of freely moving animals in real time, the visual angle under which the stripes of the pattern appeared was kept constant even for changing head positions. Furthermore, an algorithm was developed for automated evaluation of the tracking performance of the animal. Comparing the automatically determined behavioral score with manual assessment of the animals' tracking behavior confirmed the reliability of our methodology. As an example, we reproduced the known contrast sensitivity function of wild type mice. Furthermore, the progressive decline in visual performance of a mouse model of retinal degeneration, rd10, was demonstrated.",0735-7044,NA,10.1037/a0033944

This study profiled the helminth and protozoan parasites in trapped small mammals within and around human dwelling places (houses) located across 4 major towns (Auchi, Benin, Ekpoma, and Uromi) and environs in Edo state, Nigeria. Six genera (Apodemus sp., Crocidura sp., Mastomys natalensis, Mus musculus, Rattus sp., and Sorex sp.) were identified from 502 trapped small mammals. Overall, M. musculus (71.9\%) and Rattus rattus (20.1\%) were the most frequently trapped. In total, on examination of blood, gastrointestinal contents, and brain tissues, 12 helminth taxa (Angiostrongylus sp., Aspicularis sp., Capillaria sp., Gongylonema sp., Heterakis spumosa, Hymenolepis diminuta, Hymenolepis nana, Mastophorus muris, Moniliformis moniliformis, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, Strongyloides sp., Trichosomoides sp., and Trichuris sp.), and 6 protozoan parasites (Babesia sp., Trypanosoma lewisi, Plasmodium sp., Eimeria sp., Isospora sp., and Toxoplasma gondii) were isolated. Most prevalent helminths with relatively heavy mean intensity were Strongyloides sp. and Heterakis spumosa, while Plasmodium, Eimeria, and Isospora were the most prevalent protozoan parasites. Generally, intrinsic factors like sex and age had marginal influence on the rate and burden of infection in M. musculus and R. rattus. Although the infection rate and prevalence of zoonotic parasites were low, they were largely recovered in rodents from Ekpoma.

taysse_protection_2006,TOXICOLOGY,Protection against soman-induced neuropathology and respiratory failure: {A} comparison of the efficacy of diazepam and avizafone in guinea pig,"The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of diazepam and the pro-diazepam avizafone in preventing the severity of soman-induced pathology in guinea pig. Survival, respiration and seizures of experimental animals were investigated with on-line monitoring of respiratory and EEG parameters. Guinea pigs were pretreated with pyridostigmine (0.1 mg/kg i.m.) and 30 min later challenged with 1 or 2 LD50 soman. One minute after intoxication they were treated with atropine (3 or 33.8 mg/kg), pralidoxime chloride (32 mg/kg) and either diazepam (2 mg/kg), avizafone (3.5 mg/kg) or saline solution. The highest dose of atropine (33.8 mg/kg) gave a protective effect in groups treated without anticonvulsants by reducing the severity of clinical signs and death within 24h but also by decreasing seizure occurrence and brain injuries. When injected at the similar molar dose of 7 mu moles/kg, the protection of anticonvulsants against soman neurotoxicity was higher with the atropine/pralidoxime/avizafone combination than with atropine/pralidoxime/diazepam. Indeed, when atropine was used at the lowest dose, avizafone was found to prevent early mortality and seizures occurrence with better efficacy than diazepam. On the other hand, when added to the therapy, the both anticonvulsants did not prevent the moderate EEG depression (reduction of amplitude by 30-52\%) observed under 2 LD50 soman. Moreover, the number of animals suffering from respiratory distress (defined as a decrease of minute ventilation of more than 20\% from the baseline value) was enhanced when diazepam or avizafone were used in the therapy. This effect was dependent on the atropine dose and the nature of the anticonvulsant. The beneficial effects of the different therapeutics tested were assessed and compared to the previous data obtained with the same therapies against sarin and from the pharmacokinetics properties of the atropine/diazepam mixture.

The present study evaluates the effect of a 90-day continuous oral administration of a hydro-ethanolic whole plant extract of Synedrella nodiflora (SNE) in male Sprague-Dawley rats., METHODS: The toxicological evaluation of the extract (100, 300 and 1000 mgkg-1) was focused on haematological, serum biochemical parameters and histopathological changes of some isolated organs., RESULTS: The extract produced no mortality in the rats treated during the study period. Only SNE 100 mgkg-1 produced significant decrease in white blood cell and neutrophil counts and an increase in albumin, globulin, total bilirubin, total protein and potassium levels. The higher doses (SNE 300 and 1000 mgkg-1) had no significant effect on all the haematological and biochemical parameters measured. Histopathological assessment of the liver, kidney and heart revealed no abnormalities in rats treated with the extracts. Only the SNE 1000 mgkg-1 produced distortions of the branching arrangements of the myocardial fibres and a congested vessel which indicates a healed infarction., CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest hydro-ethanolic extract of Synedrella nodiflora (L) Gaertn generally has a low toxicity profile following a 90-day continuous oral administration in male Sprague-Dawley rats under the present laboratory conditions.

lancha_osteopontin_2014,PloS one,Osteopontin deletion prevents the development of obesity and hepatic steatosis via impaired adipose tissue matrix remodeling and reduced inflammation and fibrosis in adipose tissue and liver in mice.,"Osteopontin (OPN) is a multifunctional extracellular matrix (ECM) protein involved in multiple physiological processes. OPN expression is dramatically increased in visceral adipose tissue in obesity and the lack of OPN protects against the development of insulin resistance and inflammation in mice. We sought to unravel the potential mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects of the absence of OPN. We analyzed the effect of the lack of OPN in the development of obesity and hepatic steatosis induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) using OPN-KO mice. OPN expression was upregulated in epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT) and liver in wild type (WT) mice with HFD. OPN-KO mice had higher insulin sensitivity, lower body weight and fat mass with reduced adipose tissue ECM remodeling and reduced adipocyte size than WT mice under a HFD. Reduced MMP2 and MMP9 activity was involved in the decreased ECM remodeling. Crown-like structure number in EWAT as well as F4/80-positive cells and Emr1 expression in EWAT and liver increased with HFD, while OPN-deficiency blunted the increase. Moreover, our data show for the first time that OPN-KO under a HFD mice display reduced fibrosis in adipose tissue and liver, as well as reduced oxidative stress in adipose tissue. Gene expression of collagens Col1a1, Col6a1 and Col6a3 in EWAT and liver, as well as the profibrotic cytokine Tgfb1 in EWAT were increased with HFD, while OPN-deficiency prevented this increase. OPN deficiency prevented hepatic steatosis via reduction in the expression of molecules involved in the onset of fat accumulation such as Pparg, Srebf1, Fasn, Mogat1, Dgat2 and Cidec. Furthermore, OPN-KO mice exhibited higher body temperature and improved BAT function. The present data reveal novel mechanisms of OPN in the development of obesity, pointing out the inhibition of OPN as a promising target for the treatment of obesity and fatty liver.",1932-6203,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0098398

Objective: To investigate effect of co-administration of aqueous extract of T. occidentalis leaves; commonly used as antimalarial and haematinic agent in Nigeria and artesunate using P. berghei animal model. Methods: In vivo curative antiplasmodial effect of T. occidentalis (200mg/kg) alone and combination with artesunate (2mg/kg) were evaluated using albino mice infected with 10(6) parasitized erythrocytes of P. berghei intraperitoneally. The haematological parameters: haemoglobin level, red blood cells and white blood cells and packed cell volume were monitored using standard methods. Results: Aqueous extract of T. occidentalis, artesunate and the combination gave 72.17 +/- 4.07\%, 70.43 +/- 4.27\% and 85.43 +/- 3.65\% reduction in parasitaemia after 48hours respectively. A significant enhancement of the PCV was obtained with the co-administration of artesunate and aqueous extract (p{\textless}0.01). Similar trends were also observed with heamatological parameters at 72hours of administration. Conclusion: This study revealed a synergistic effect of the co-administration on parasite clearance rate of P. berghei infection in mice, with a significant enhancement of haematological parameters within 48 hours of administration. This indicates a rapid rate of recovery from plasmodial infections with the co-administration.",1680-6905,NA,10.4314/ahs.v13i4.16
dobigny_cytotaxonomic_2011,Mammalian Biology,A cytotaxonomic and {DNA}-based survey of rodents from {Northern} {Cameroon} and {Western} {Chad}.,"Rodent diagnosis has long remained obscured by the co-existence of cryptic species in many lineages. However, alternative and accessible methods, such as cytotaxonomy and DNA-based methods, are now available that allow biologists to accurately monitor biodiversity through the production of well documented lists of unambiguously species-specific identifications. As a continuation of our previous surveys of West African rodents, we here present the first rodent inventory of rodents from Northern Cameroon (as well as one locality in Western Chad) that fully relies on karyotypic and/or sequencing data. Doing so, we assess the presence of 18 species in this poorly documented region. Among them, we found several African spiny mice that could be referred as to A. johannis, a poorly documented species. Moreover, several Arvicanthis individuals could be aggregated with previously studied but still enigmatic specimens of ANI-2 and ANI-4 sensu Volobouev etal. (2002a,b), thus suggesting that they may all belong to one single species, namely A. rufinus. In addition, one specimen was shown to belong to a new biological species (Praomys sp.) that will deserve further taxonomic investigations. Finally, several Taterillus specimens were found with 2n =28-30 chromosomes and a XX/XY1Y2 sex chromosome system. On the basis of these new results as well as a reinterpretation of previously published data, we propose to refer these individuals as to the poorly documented Taterillus lacustris. Altogether, our data suggest that Northern Cameroon is a ""phylogeographical node"" for several rodent lineages which may be at least partly explained by the past changes within the Lake Chad basin.

ark_does_1999,GENERAL PHARMACOLOGY,Does prevention of free radical reactions influence digoxin-arrhythmias,"In the present study, the possible role of oxygen-derived free radicals (OFR) on digoxin- (0.6 mg/kg(-1) IV bolus) induced arrhythmias of anesthetized guinea-pigs has been investigated. Guinea-pigs (300-400 g) of either sex were anesthetized with urethane (1.5 g/kg(-1), IF), and their trachea for respiration,left common carotid artery for blood pressure monitoring, and right jugular vein for drug administration were cannulated. ECG and haemodynamics were recorded throughout the experiments. None of the agents used [N-acetyl-L-cysteine (20 mg/kg(-1) IV bolus), or SOD (30,000 IU/kg(-1) IV bolus) + catalase (15,000 IU/kg-1 IV bolus)] significantly inhibited the arrhythmias except desferrioxamine which reduced the incidence of ventricular fibrillation and arrhythmia score. Desferrioxamine, by acting intracellularly unlike other agents used, might prevent the reduction of Fe+3 by ascorbate and superoxide anion thus inhibiting the formation of cytotoxic hydroxyl radical in this experimental setting.

boone_scavenging_2009-1,VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES,Scavenging by {Mammalian} {Carnivores} on {Prairie} {Dog} {Colonies}: {Implications} for the {Spread} of {Plague,"Plague causes mass mortality of prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) in shortgrass steppe. Although the pathogen, the bacterium Yersinia pestis, is spread within colonies by flea bites or contact between infected hosts, it is unclear how Y. pestis is transported over long distances between isolated colonies. One possibility is that wide-ranging, plague-resistant mammalian carnivores pick up fleas when scavenging prairie dog carcasses. Using guinea pigs as surrogates for prairie dogs, we compared how quickly scavengers discovered carcasses on active prairie dog colonies, on colonies recently extirpated by plague, and in grasslands without prairie dogs. In June-July 2007, we monitored the fates of 20 guinea pig carcasses for 4 consecutive days on each site type. Ten carcasses were placed in wire exclosures that restricted access only to arthropods and small rodents; the other 10 were exposed to all scavengers. Scavengers were identified by tracks, evidence of consumption, and/or remote cameras. Carnivores discovered carcasses more quickly on active and plague colonies (mean +/- 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6 +/- 0.7, 1.4 +/- 1.4 days, respectively) than on grasslands (3.1 +/- 0.7 days). By the end of the trials, all (100\%) exposed carcasses were removed from active colonies, whereas 60\% were removed from plague colonies and 30\% were removed from grasslands. Rates of carcass discovery and removal on active colonies were significantly greater than in grasslands, which mirrored differences in carnivore activity recorded during earlier scat surveys. A small fraction (30\%-40\%) of carcasses in exclosures were eaten by rodents, but only on active and plague colonies, suggesting that small rodents, presumably grasshopper mice (Onychomys leucogaster), may also consume carcasses and pick up fleas if carcasses are not removed by carnivores first. These results, combined with observations that fleas remain alive on prairie dogs at least 1 day following their death, suggest that carnivores may encounter infectious fleas while scavenging, and they could transport them over long distances.",1530-3667,NA,10.1089/vbz.2008.0034
novakova_effects_2008,GENERAL PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOPHYSICS,Effects of voltage sensitive dye di-4-{ANEPPS} on guinea pig and rabbit myocardium,"Voltage-sensitive dyes(VSDs) are used to record transient potential changes in various cardiac preparations. In our laboratory, action potentials have been recorded by optical probe using di-4-ANEPPS. In this study, the effects of two different ways of staining were compared in guinea pig and rabbit isolated hearts perfused according to Langendorff staining either by coronary perfusion with low dye concentration or with concentrated dye as a bolus into the aorta. Staining with low dye concentration lead to its better persistence in the tissue. Electrogram and coronary flow were monitored continuously. During the staining and washout of the dye, prominent electrophysiological changes occurred such as a decrease in spontaneous heart rate, partial atrioventricular block and changes of ST-T segment, accompanied by a decrease in mean coronary flow. No production of hydroxyl radicals was found by HPLC which excluded significant ischemic damage of the myocardium. Good viability of the stained preparation was supported by unchanged electron microscopy. Since in rabbit hearts the VSD-induced arrhythmogenesis was less pronounced, we conclude that the rabbit myocardium is more resistant to the changes triggered by VSD application. It may be due to different properties of the membrane potassium channels in the cardiomyocytes of these two species.",0231-5882,NA,NA
ishiguro_bicarbonate_1996,JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON,Bicarbonate secretion in interlobular ducts from guinea-pig pancreas,"1. The transport of HCO3- across the luminal membrane of pancreatic duct cells was studied by monitoring the luminal pH of isolated guinea-pig interlobular ducts after microinjection of an extracellular fluoroprobe, the dextran conjugate of 2'7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF-dextran). Luminal Cl- concentration was also measured by microfluorometry following microinjection of the dextran conjugates of 6-methoxy-N-(4-aminoalkyl)quinolinium bromide (ABQ-dextran) and Cl-NERF (Cl-NERF-dextran). 2. When HCO3-/CO2 was admitted to the bath, a transient acidification of the duct lumen was observed, followed by a marked alkalinization. The latter was abolished when the luminal Cl- concentration was reduced to 25-35 mM by replacement with glucuronate and may. therefore, be attributed to Clâ€“HCO3- exchange at the luminal membrane. 3. Secretin, forskolin and acetylcholine stimulated HCO3- secretion into the lumen even when the luminal Cl- concentration was reduced to approximately 7 mM. Furthermore, agonist-evoked HCO3- secretion was not inhibited by luminal glibenclamide, dihydro-4,4'diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid (H2DIDS) or 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoic acid (NPPB). These observations are not easily reconciled with HCO3- transport across the luminal membrane being mediated by Clâ€“HCO3- exchange in parallel with a Cl- conductance. 4. Agonist-stimulated HCO3- secretion was blocked by omitting Na+ from the bath but not by addition of N-methyl-N-isobutylamiloride (MIA) or bafilomycin A(1). This supports our previous conclusion that HCO3- entry into duct cells from the extracellular fluid requires Na+ but is not dependent on Na+-H+ exchange or vacuolar-type H+-ATPase activity. 5. The three actions of secretin on guinea-pig pancreatic duct cells described in this and the accompanying paper - stimulation of a relatively Clâ€“insensitive luminal HCO3- efflux pathway, stimulation of basolateral Na+-HCO3- cotransport, and lack of effect on intracellular pH - require the current model of pancreatic HCO3- secretion to be modified.",0022-3751,NA,10.1113/jphysiol.1996.sp021583

sato_pharmacokinetics_2007,DRUG METABOLISM AND PHARMACOKINETICS,Pharmacokinetics of theophylline in guinea pig tears,"It is well recognized that the theophylline (TP) concentration in human tears correlates well with the free TP concentration in human plasma. However this correlation was found only in a very narrow range of concentrations of TP, and pharmacokinetic analysis of TP in tears has not been carried out for a wide range of concentrations of TP. The aims of this investigation were to develop a simple kinetic model for TP in guinea pig plasma (total [Cf+b] and free [Cf]), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [C] CSF and tears [C] T, and to examine whether [Cf], [Cf+ b] and [C] CSF can be predicted from [C] T using the resulting kinetic parameters. [Cf+ b], [Cf], [C] CSF and [C] T were determined by GC/EI-SIM following bolus i. v. injection of TP in doses of 10, 50 and 100 mg/kg into guinea pigs. The wide range of concentrations of [Cf+b] could be quantitatively described by a two-compartment model with non-linear elimination kinetics and individual volume distribution of TP at each dose. [C] T and [C] CSF were analyzed using passive diffusion models with and without the pH-partition theory, respectively. The value of [Cf] could be predicted from the value of [C] T. Thus, the measurement of [C] T which can be collected non-invasively would be a useful method for the therapeutic drug monitoring of TP.",1347-4367,NA,10.2133/dmpk.22.169

olayemi_contribution_2011,Wildlife Research,Contribution of {DNA}-typing to bushmeat surveys: assessment of a roadside market in south-western {Nigeria}.,"Context. Following recent socioeconomic transformations in western and central Africa, the volume of bushmeat hunting, a traditional source of proteins and revenue for rural populations, has reached unsustainable levels. The morphological identification of species sold on bushmeat market stalls may be challenging because of the presence of cryptic taxa and smoked or processed carcasses. Aims. To assess the contribution of DNA-typing to traditional bushmeat surveys. We conducted a case study at a roadside bushmeat market in Asejire, south-western Nigeria, to characterise the mammalian diversity and sketch out the dynamics of the bushmeat trade. Methods. We generated a 402-bp Cytochrome b fragment using a 'universal' mitochondrial primer pair that successfully amplified across five mammalian orders, and used assignment procedures to assess the taxonomic identification of the traded species. We combined DNA-typing with morphological-based market surveys and questionnaires to half (n = 20) of the market stakeholders. Key results. Our combined morphological-DNA-based survey revealed a total of 17 species, representing seven mammalian orders (Rodentia, Lagomorpha, Primates, Hyracoidea, Carnivora, Pholidota and Artiodactyla). DNA-typing allowed identifying the Walter's duiker, a cryptic, newly described species from the Dahomey Gap, and diagnosing an unidentified primate as the white-throated monkey, Cercopithecus erythrogaster, a species of high conservation concern in Nigeria. K2P pairwise genetic distances among all species exceeded the 11\% threshold, indicative of species-level distinction. The most hunted species were the Walter's duiker and, to a lesser extent, the greater cane rat, Thryonomys swinderianus. Questionnaires to traders revealed that the Asejire roadside market was a straightforward trader-hunter system centralising off-takes from distant hunting sites. Conclusions. We showed how mitochondrial DNA-typing combined with assignment procedures improved the characterisation of the mammalian diversity sold on bushmeat markets. The hunted mammalian community consisted of versatile, small-to medium-sized secondary forest species characteristic of the Dahomey Gap assemblage; their sustainable management is in doubt because of the lack of conservation and health awareness within the traders' community. Implications. Given the utility of mitochondrial DNA-typing in identifying species sold in bushmeat markets, we argue in favour of multi-entry investigations to reach a comprehensive characterisation of the bushmeat trade. The building of a web-accessible mtDNA database covering the spectrum of the species hunted for bushmeat would appear to be a valuable diagnostic tool that may help Nigeria and neighbouring countries to set up a rigorous monitoring of wildlife extirpation.",1035-3712,NA,NA
duan_comparative_1995,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY,Comparative studies on differential inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system in the anesthetized guinea pig,"The present study compares the hemodynamic effects and mechanisms of action of angiotensin II (AngII) antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and renin inhibitors in the guinea pig, an animal with high similarity to primates in terms of in vitro and in vivo responses to several human renin inhibitors. Animals were anesthetized with urethane and ketamine. The carotid artery was catheterized for monitoring blood pressure and heart rate. After 30 min stabilization, drug (or vehicle) effects were monitored for 1 h following each increasing dose (i.v. bolus injection). Drugs tested include losartan, an AngII receptor antagonist; two renin inhibitors, BILA 2157 BS and PD-134672; and captopril, an ACE inhibitor. All drugs dose dependently decreased blood pressure. Diastolic blood pressure was reduced more than systolic blood pressure, suggestive of vasodilation. The maximum decrease (32 +/- 6\%, p {\textless} 0.05 vs. vehicle) in mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) by losartan was achieved with a dose of 1 mg/kg. A similar decrease in MABP was observed with renin inhibitors at a dose of 3 mg/kg, without affecting heart rate. A further increase in the dose of renin inhibitors (6 mg/kg) decreased not only blood pressure but also heart rate. Captopril decreased MABP with a maximum of 48 +/- 3\% (p {\textless} 0.05 vs. vehicle, losartan, and PD-134672). In the presence of HOE-140, a bradykinin antagonist, the MABP decrease by captopril was only 35 +/- 4\%, (p {\textless} 0.05 vs. captopril alone). Bilateral nephrectomy reduced the peak MABP effect of PD-134672 by 67\%, while the effects of captopril on MABP were affected to a lesser degree (57\%). Therefore, captopril remains more effective in reducing MABP (p {\textless} 0.05 vs. that of PD-134672). These results suggest that renin inhibitors and AngII antagonists act more specifically on the renin-angiotensin system cascade, while captopril acts partially by a bradykinin-dependent mechanism. The small animal model described provides a novel tool for the comparative pharmacologic assessment of different renin-angiotensin system inhibitors.",0008-4212,NA,10.1139/y95-209

Systemic administration of the serotonin release-inducing agent fenfluramine (3 or 10 mg/kg, i.p.) increased acetylcholine release by 110-130\%. The fenfluramine-induced increase in acetylcholine release was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with the selective serotonin uptake inhibitor fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), Pretreatment with the selective dopamine D-1 receptor antagonist SCH-23390 (0.3 mg/kg, s.c.) failed to prevent the fenfluramine-induced increase in acetylcholine release. In contrast, the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (5 mg/kg, i.p.) blocked fenfluramine-induced increases in acetylcholine release. In contrast to previous studies that have concluded that serotonin has inhibitory actions on cortical acetylcholine release, the present results indicate that fenfluramine increases cortical acetylcholine release in vivo by its ability to enhance serotonin transmission and that serotonin produces these effects at least in part via actions at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors.",0022-3042,NA,NA
bakmiwewa_synergistic_2016,Cytokine,Synergistic induction of {CXCL10} by interferon-gamma and lymphotoxin-alpha in astrocytes: {Possible} role in cerebral malaria.,"Cerebral malaria (CM) has a high mortality rate and incidence of neurological sequelae in survivors. Hypoxia and cytokine expression in the brain are two mechanisms thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of CM. The cytokines interferon (IFN)-gamma and lymphotoxin (LT)-alpha and the chemokine CXCL10 are essential for the development of CM in a mouse model. Furthermore, serum IFN-gamma protein levels are higher in human CM than in controls, and CXCL10 is elevated in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid in Ghanaian paediatric CM cases. Astrocytes actively participate in CNS pathologies, becoming activated in response to various stimuli including cytokines. Astrocyte activation also occurs in murine and human CM. We here determined the responsiveness of mouse and human astrocytes to IFN-gamma and LT-alpha, with the aim of further elucidating the role of astrocytes in CM pathogenesis. Initially we confirmed that Ifn-gamma and Cxcl10 are expressed in the brain in murine CM, and that the increased Cxcl10 expression is IFN-gamma-dependant. IFN-gamma induced CXCL10 production in human and murine astrocytes in vitro. The degree of induction was increased synergistically in the presence of LT-alpha. IFN-gamma induced the expression of receptors for LT-alpha, while LT-alpha increased the expression of the receptor for IFN-gamma, in the astrocytes. This cross-induction may explain the synergistic effect of the two cytokines on CXCL10 production. Expression of these receptors also was upregulated in the brain in murine CM. The results suggest that astrocytes contribute to CM pathogenesis by producing CXCL10 in response to IFN-gamma and LT-alpha. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Smith, 1834) were studied in southeastern Senegal in order to evaluate some elements of their social structure. Analysis of trapping data consisting in single and multiple captures indicates that adult males were less likely to be involved in multiple captures than any other category of individuals. Sex-ratio in adults was significantly female-biased, and multiple captures involving 4 individuals or more (up to 13) were characterized by the small number of adult males involved (usually one per capture). Dyadic encounters between males revealed a higher rate of aggressive behaviours in M. natalensis than in its sibling species M. huberti. These observations suggest that these synanthropic populations are subdivided in polygynous units in which: (1) a part of males are evicted from the social group before their maturity and (2) adult males of different social units display aggressive behaviour towards each other.",0001-7051,NA,10.4098/AT.arch.93-3

Swiss OF1 albino mice were exposed individually to 200 cercariae and worms were recovered 9, 12, 16 and 20 weeks post infection. The mean worm returns ranged between 10.54 and 13.05\% and did not alter significantly between 9 and 20 weeks post infection.

From the 12th week post infection, a high number of eggs was found in the liver and gut. At 20 weeks, eggs were also found in the bladder. Viable eggs and infective miracidia were obtained. The infection of Bulinus truncatus from Niger succeeded with a mean rate of 61\% after the first passage through mice. The isolate of S. haematobium was maintained in the laboratory during 3 successive passages through mice.

The most celebrated of these mountains are the East and West Usambaras. Although these massifs have been the subjects of biological study for over a century, little is known about the shrews, bats, and rodents occurring in the montane forests. Using pitfall buckets, small mammal traps, and mist-nets, between 1991 and 1993, we surveyed the small mammals in the Amani area in the East Usambara and Ambangulu area in the West Usambara to document the natural history of the local fauna. These surveys were conducted during the dry season annually between early July and early September. In this chapter, we outline the study sites, methodologies, capture rates, and other trapping details. A total of 18,563 sample-nights was accrued over the three-year study, and on these two massifs, we documented 12 crocidurine shrew, one macroscelidid elephant shrew, 19 bat, and 14 rodent species. Species accumulation curves suggest that additional trapping effort may be required in the East Usambara Mountains to have a more complete view of the local small mammal fauna. There was no significant difference in the number of individuals captured or measures of species diversity in the pitfall and trap lines that were installed in the same location during the course of this study, suggesting that repeated sampling did not negatively affect the small mammal fauna of the study areas.",2158-5520,NA,NA
nupp_landscape-level_2000,Journal of Mammalogy,Landscape-level correlates of small-mammal assemblages in forest fragments of farmland.,"We studied effects of forest fragmentation on 15 species of small mammals, including 6 species of forest-dwelling granivorous rodents, in the Indian Pine watershed of west-central Indiana. Presence-absence and population densities of small mammals were assessed in spring in 35 woodlots of various sizes (0.1-150 ha) and 2 continuous forest sites ({\textgreater}1,000 ha) using live traps in 1992-1996. Presence-absence and population density were related to landscape attributes using logistic and multiple linear regression models, respectively. Species richness of forest-dwelling small mammals increased with area and was highest in continuous forest sites. Nested subsets of the full complement of species were found in smaller woodlots. White-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) were ubiquitous, and eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) were nearly ubiquitous across the landscape; densities of both species were related inversely to forested area. Fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) were found at 84\% of study sites, and they did not respond negatively to isolation of forest patches. Red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) were unevenly distributed across the landscape and were found most often in woodlots with large core areas and simple shapes, possibly indicating sensitivity to edge. Southern flying squirrels (Glaucomys volans) and gray squirrels (S. carolinensis) were restricted to continuous forest sites and {\textgreater}4.6-ha woodlots adjacent to other wooded habitat. Species of small mammals differ appreciably in their sensitivities to agriculturally induced fragmentation of forests. Interspecific differences within this assemblage were not due solely, or even primarily, to body size. Rather, differential responses of species to fragmentation likely resulted from variation in habitat breadth and ability to move through an agricultural matrix.",0022-2372,NA,10.1644/1545-1542(2000)081<0512:LLCOSM>2.0.CO;2
warr_multiple_1996,HEARING RESEARCH,Multiple projections from the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body in the rat,"An analysis of the central projections of the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body (VNTB) in the rat, a region of the superior olivary complex known for its neuronal heterogeneity, was made using two anterograde axonal tracers, [H-3]leucine and biotinylated dextran amine (BDA). A mixture of these tracers was injected iontophoretically into the VNTB and the results analyzed by first assessing magnitudes of autoradiographic signal in nuclei receiving projections and then identifying the axons and terminals responsible for this signal in parallel sets of sections processed for BDA. Our analysis showed that in addition to its projections to each cochlea via the olivocochlear bundle, the VNTB has 3 major central sites of axonal terminations: (1) the cochlear nucleus, particularly the molecular layer of the contralateral dorsal cochlear nucleus, (2) the contralateral lateral superior olive, and (3) the ipsilateral inferior colliculus. Other sites receiving projections from the VNTB included the VNTB itself and the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus. Significantly, the relative magnitudes of labeling within the nuclei receiving inputs from the VNTB varied consistently as a function of the dorsoventral location of the injection site, confirming previous work showing that there is a partial segregation within this nucleus of neurons according to their projections. Our data also revealed an orderly topographic pattern of projections to the cochlear nuclei, lateral superior olive and the inferior colliculus which is consistent with the known tonotopic organization both of the VNTB and these projection targets. Methodologically, the co-injection of two tracers was advantageous in that patterns of silver grains in autoradiographs could be used to confirm whether axons and terminals labeled with BDA had originated from labeled somata at the injection site or were the result of uptake of BDA by fibers of passage.",0378-5955,NA,10.1016/0378-5955(95)00198-0
wright_cigarette_2004,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY CELL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,Cigarette smoke induces persisting increases of vasoactive mediators in pulmonary arteries,"The pathogenesis of cigarette smoke-induced pulmonary hypertension is not understood. We previously reported that a single smoke exposure acutely but transiently upregulated gene expression of the vasoconstrictor/vasoproliferative agents endothelin (ET) and vascular endothellial growth factor in pulmonary arteries from rat lungs. To determine whether similar changes occurred with chronic smoke exposure, we exposed Hartley guinea pigs, an outbred strain that develops pulmonary hypertension, to smoke for 2, 4, or 12 wk. Small intrapulmonary artery branches were isolated using laser capture microdissection, and gene expression was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. In smoke-exposed animals, there were significantly elevated but variable increases in gene expression, with some animals demonstrating 30- to 50-fold increases. Increases in ET and vascular endothelial growth factor expression occurred early and persisted through the exposure period, whereas increases in expression of the vasodilator, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, developed more slowly. Protein levels of these mediators were also elevated by immunohistochemical staining and correlated with increases in gene expression levels. We conclude that, in some animals, cigarette smoke induces persisting and marked vascular production of mediators that control vascular muscularization and contraction/ dilation. These changes may be important in the development of smoke-induced pulmonary hypertension.",1044-1549,NA,10.1165/rcmb.2004-0051OC

Submucosal-mucosal preparations mounted in standard Ussing chambers were studied at time 0, at 8 h, and 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 30 days following the intraluminal instillation of TNBS or saline. Maximal DeltaI(sc) responses to capsaicin were dramatically attenuated (54\%) by 24 h. By day 7, SP- and TTX-insensitive carbachol-stimulated DeltaI(sc) were also significantly reduced. Similar attenuation in capsaicin and carbachol responses was observed in jejunal tissue 20 cm proximal to the inflamed site at day 7. These studies demonstrate that efferent secretomotor function of capsaicin-sensitive nerves is maintained early in TNBS ileitis but significantly reduced by 24 h. By day 7, defects in enterocyte secretory function at inflamed and non-inflamed sites also occurred, an effect that may be mediated by circulating cytokines.",0193-1857,NA,10.1152/ajpgi.00037.2001
akanmu_neuropharmacological_2011,"African journal of traditional, complementary, and alternative medicines : AJTCAM",Neuropharmacological effects of {Nigerian} honey in mice.,"Honey is a natural sweet substance that bees produce by transforming flower nectar or other sweet secretions of plants. It has widespread use in traditional medicine in various parts of the world. It has been reported to assist in building the entire central nervous system. The beneficial effects of honey have been attributed to the possible polyphenolic contents and some other constituents. The geographical locations and the sources of plant nectars may contribute to the effects of honey samples. Thus, we evaluated the neuropharmacological effects of six samples of honey (10\%, 20\% and 40\%(V)/v, p.o.) from three geographical locations of Nigeria using the following behavioral models: Novelty-induced behaviors (NIB), learning and memory, pentobarbital-induced hypnosis, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, analgesic and antidepressant models in mice. The results showed that honey significantly (p{\textless} 0.05) decreased locomotion and rearing behaviors in NIB and amphetamine-induced locomotor activity when compared to the control group. Exploratory behavior was significantly increased in both holeboard and elevated plus maze but had no significant effect on spatial working memory. Honey sample from Umudike has significant hypnotic and anticonvulsant effects. The antinociceptive models (hot plate and tail flick tests) showed that the honey samples significantly increased the pain reaction time and naloxone blocked these central antinociceptive effects. The force swimming test showed that only the Idanre (ID) honey sample had antidepressant effect. In conclusion, some of these honey samples have central inhibitory property, anxiolytic, antinociceptive, anticonvulsant and antidepressant effects, thus may be used as nutraceutic. It can also be inferred that some of these effects are probably mediated through dopaminergic and opioidergic systems.",2505-0044,NA,NA

The aim of this study was to evaluate selected plants extracts used against malaria in Nigeria for antiplasmodial activity., MATERIALS AND METHODS: An ethnomedicinal based - approach by literature survey was used to identify plants used in the study. The parts of the plant used were collected and extracted with 70\% v/v ethanol; a portion of each extract was used to prepare successive solvent and residual fractions. Chloroquine-sensitive (3D7) P. falciparum strain and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were used for antiplasmodial and cytotoxicity screening respectively. Hemolysis assay was also carried out on red blood cells (RBCs). Test for in vivo efficacy of an active extract was conducted in a mouse model of established P. berghei ANKA-infection., RESULTS: A total of six plants; Andropogon schirensis, Celtis durandii, Chasmanthera dependens, Daniellia ogea, Icacina trichantha and Triumfetta cordifolia were selected and screened. Triumfetta cordifolia leaf extract was observed to display moderate in vitro antiplasmodial activity (IC50 = 48.09 mug/ml) and was non-toxic to HEK293 cells and erythrocytes. At a dose of 400 mg/kg, T. cordifolia significantly (p{\textless}0.001) suppressed parasitemia, significantly (p{\textless}0.001) inhibited RBC depletion and prolonged survival in infected mice., CONCLUSIONS: T. cordifolia ethanol extract possesses antiplasmodial efficacy and this is the first report of its kind on the plant. It is a potential candidate for further studies to identify its mechanism of action. Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1872-7573,NA,10.1016/j.jep.2020.112694

Design: The ability of compounds to inhibit MMPs in vitro was assessed kinetically using a quenched fluorescent substrate. Rats were injected with iodoacetate intraarticularly in one knee joint and damage to the tibial plateau was evaluated from digitized images captured using an image analyser and by histology. Collagenase and gelatinase activity in cartilage from iodoacetate injected knees were evaluated using H-3-rat type I collagen and gelatin zymography, respectively. Results: Collagenase and gelatinase activity significantly increased in the knee cartilage of rats injected with iodoacetate with peak activity by day 7. Three MMP inhibitors were examined for their efficacy in the rat iodoacetate-induced arthritis model. Significant (P{\textless}0.05) inhibition of cartilage damage was observed in animals treated orally with 35 mg/kg b.i.d. of the three different MMP inhibitors. Inhibition of cartilage damage by the MMP inhibitors ranged from 36-42\%. Conclusion: MMP inhibitors are partially protective against cartilage and subchondral bone damage induced by iodoacetate. These results support an important role for MMPs in mediating the joint damage in this model of arthritis. (C) 2001 OsteoArthritis Research Society International.",1063-4584,NA,10.1053/joca.2001.0472

berthier_black_2016-1,BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY,Black rat invasion of inland {Sahel}: insights from interviews and population genetics in south-western {Niger,"Human population migrations, as well as long-distance trade activities, have been responsible for the spread of many invasive organisms. The black rat, Rattus rattus, has colonized most of the world following ship-mediated trade. Owing to its tight association with human infrastructures, this species has been able to survive in unfavourable environments, such as Sahelian Africa. In this work, we combined interview-based and population genetic surveys to investigate the processes underlying the ongoing invasion of south-western Niger by black rats, with special emphasis on the capital city, Niamey. Our trapping and interview data are quite congruent, and all together point towards a patchy, but rather widespread, current distribution of R. rattus. Genetic data strongly suggest that road network development for truck-based commercial flow from/to international harbours located in neighbouring countries (Benin, Togo, and Nigeria) facilitates the passive dispersal of black rats over a long distance through unfavourable landscapes. Another potentially, more ancient, invasion route may be associated with boat transport along the Niger River. Human-mediated dispersal thus probably allows the foundation of persisting populations within highly anthropized areas while population dynamics may be more unstable in remote areas and mostly depends on propagule pressure.",0024-4066,NA,10.1111/bij.12836

Abundance and demographics of small mammals were compared between plots with abundant CWD created by a tornado (unsalvaged plots) and plots where tornado-created CWD had been removed (salvaged plots). Species composition was similar between unsalvaged and salvaged plots, but more small mammals were captured on unsalvaged plots. Cotton mice (Peromyscus gossypinus) were the most abundant species captured in all plots and were significantly more abundant in unsalvaged plots in every trapping period. Adult female P. gossypinus in unsalvaged plots had greater survival and were more likely to be in reproductive condition than adult females in salvaged plots. Southern short-tailed shrews (Blarina carolinensis) and cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) tended to be more abundant in unsalvaged plots. Fox squirrels (Sciurus niger), the second most abundant species in salvaged plots, were never captured on unsalvaged plots. Large amounts of CWD improve habitat quality of pine forests for P. gossypinus, and CWD is probably an important habitat component for other species.",0022-2372,NA,10.2307/1383293

The antibodies were characterized by the Ouchterlony double diffusion technique and by antibody capture assay. The working range of the indirect competitive assay developed was between 0.45 and 330 ng of the analyte [calf thymus (CT)-DNA-AFB(1)]. A 50\% inhibition was attained at 15 ng of the analyte (CT-DNA-AFB(1)). The antibody capture assay indicated that the antibody produced cross-reacted 100, 92 and 110\% with BSA-guanine-AFB(1), CT-DNA-AFB(1) and CT-DNA-formamidopyrimidine-AFB(1), respectively. When free AFB(1) and guanine were used as competing analytes, the antibodies showed less than or equal to 5\% and zero cross-reactivity at the 50\% inhibition level, Spiking studies indicated a recovery in the range 96-97 and 74-78\% when standard CT-DNA-AFB(1) was added to 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and control rat liver tissue, respectively. Rats exposed to a single oral dose of 1 mg kg(-1) body mass of pure AFB(1) were used to validate the method, The AFB(1)-DNA adduct formed in the liver tissue after 48 h of exposure was determined using the ELISA method developed.

Tissue was fixed with paraformaldehyde immediately after 3 min exposure to H-3-leucine in order to trap H-3 associated with macromolecules. The rate of H-3-leucine incorporation into dendrites of resting hippocampal slices was 10\% the rate of incorporation into cell somata. Ninety percent of the incorporation into the somata was inhibited by cycloheximide (300 mum); none of the incorporation into dendrites was blocked by cycloheximide. Thus, there is no measurable extramitochondrial synthesis of protein in the dendrites of the resting slice. Slices were exposed to 50 mum carbachol and the Schaffer collateral afferents to the CA1 pyramidal cells were stimulated intermittently at 10 Hz over a 20 min period. In this case, H-3 incorporation into dendrites was increased almost threefold over resting levels, with no effect on label over the cell somata. There was no associated increase in uptake of free H-3-leucine, and the increase in label was completely blocked by cycloheximide. Thus, associating carbachol and afferent stimulation appears to activate de novo protein synthesis in the dendrites. Neither the carbachol alone nor the Schaffer collateral stimulation alone increased synthesis. The activation of dendrite synthesis was completely blocked by 5 mum atropine, and also by 50 muM D-aminophosphonovalerate. It did not occur when carbachol was paired with steady stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals at 1 Hz for 20 min, rather than with the patterned high-frequency stimulation. Thus, associating a cholinergic agonist with a level of neural activity that occurs in CA3 and CA 1 pyramidal cells during exploratory behavior (Muller et al., 1987) initiates local protein synthesis in target dendrites. This effect is dependent on muscarinic cholinergic receptors and NMDA-type glutamate receptors. The possible relationship of this phenomenon to mechanisms of learning is discussed.",0270-6474,NA,NA
okolo_analgesic_1995,Journal of ethnopharmacology,Analgesic effect of {Irvingia} gabonensis stem bark extract.,"Irvingia gabonensis is used medicinally in most parts of tropical Africa for the treatment of a number of ailments. In West Africa the Mende tribe of Sierra Leone uses the stem bark to relieve pain. In order to establish a pharmacological rationale for the traditional use of this plant as a remedy for pain, the water and ethanol extracts of the powdered stem bark were screened for analgesic activity and compared with standard analgesic drugs. The water extract and morphine protected the mice from heat-induced pain. In contrast, the ethanol extract and metamizole sodium showed very low level of analgesic activity in this test. However, using tail pressure as a source of pain, the water and ethanol extracts, metamizole sodium and morphine offered protection to the mice against pain stimuli. Morphine and the water extract were more potent as analgesic agents in heat than non-heat pain test. The analgesic effects of the water extract and morphine were blocked by a non-selective opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone in both tests, whereas the analgesic effects of the ethanol extract and metamizole sodium were not antagonized by the same dose of the opioid antagonist. The data presented in this study suggest that the active principle(s) in the water extract has analgesic profile similar to that of the narcotic analgesic and the ethanol extract might contain compound(s) that behave like non-narcotic analgesic agent. These findings provide for the first time the pharmacological basis for the folkloric use of Irvingia gabonensis in the relief of pain.",0378-8741,NA,NA
cragg_heterogeneity_1997,JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY,"Heterogeneity of electrically evoked dopamine release and reuptake in substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and striatum","Somatodendritic dopamine (DA) released in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) may mediate extrasynaptic neuronal signaling. The concentration of extracellular DA ([DA](o)) attained during somatodendritic activation will be governed by the density of release sites and properties of DA uptake. We evaluated these factors in SNc, VTA, and dorsal striatum with carbon-fiber microelectrodes and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to monitor [DA](o) during local electrical stimulation (10 Hz, 5 s) in guinea pig brain slices. Stimulated DA efflux was site specific, with significantly higher [DA](o) in caudal (0.48 +/- 0.03 mu M, mean +/- SE) than rostral SNc (0.16 +/- 0.01 mu M), averaged over their mediolateral extents, and higher [DA](o) in VTA (0.74 +/- 0.07 mu M) than in medial (0.43 +/- 0.04 mu M) or lateral SNc (0.29 +/- 0.05 mu M), averaged rostrocaudally. Throughout SNc, evoked [DA](o) correlated positively (r = 0.91) with the density of tyrosine-hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells. Modulation of evoked [DA](o) by uptake was also site specific. The selective DA uptake inhibitor GBR 12909 significantly increased evoked [DA](o) in caudal SNc (to 185 +/- 27\%) and striatum (408 +/- 24\%), but had no effect in rostral SNc or VTA. Conversely, the norepinephrine (NE) uptake inhibitor desipramine did not alter stimulated [DA](o) in caudal SNc or striatum, but caused significant enhancement in rostral SNc (196 +/- 17\%) and VTA (126 +/- 12\%). Paroxetine, a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine uptake inhibitor, had little effect in any region tested. Site-specific sensitivity to desipramine mandated evaluation of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase immunoreactivity (D beta H-ir) in midbrain. The density of filaments positive for D beta H-ir was greater in rostral SNc and VTA than in caudal SNc, suggesting DA clearance via the NE transporter in these regions. Importantly, D beta H-ir was most dense in sections rostral to SNc where no catecholamine signal was detected and no enhancement was observed with desipramine, indicating a lack of NE contribution to evoked release in any region examined. Taken together, these data confirmed that evoked somatodendritic [DA](o) depends on DA cell density and on local uptake properties. Uptake was less efficient in SNc and VTA than in striatum. Moreover, enhancement of stimulated [DA](o) by GBR 12909 demonstrated that evoked release from dendrites is not via reversal of the DA transporter. Lastly, the heterogeneous patterns of DA uptake within SNc and VTA were consistent with the pattern of degeneration in Parkinson's disease: less vulnerable DA cells, e.g., those in VTA, have less DA uptake than the more vulnerable cells of caudal SNc.",0022-3077,NA,NA

Presence-absence and population densities of small mammals were assessed in spring in 35 woodlots of various sizes (0.1-150 ha) and 2 continuous forest sites ({\textgreater}1,000 ha) using live traps in 1992-1996. Presence-absence and population density were related to landscape attributes using logistic and multiple linear regression models, respectively. Species richness of forest-dwelling small mammals increased with area and was highest in continuous forest sites. Nested subsets of the full complement of species were found in smaller woodlots. White-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) were ubiquitous, and eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) were nearly ubiquitous across the landscape; densities of both species were related inversely to forested area. Fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) were found at 84\% of study sites, and they did not respond negatively to isolation of forest patches. Red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) were unevenly distributed across the landscape and were found most often in woodlots with large core areas and simple shapes, possibly indicating sensitivity to edge. Southern flying squirrels (Glaucomys volans) and gray squirrels (S. carolinensis) were restricted to continuous forest sites and {\textgreater}4.6-ha woodlots adjacent to other wooded habitat. Species of small mammals differ appreciably in their sensitivities to agriculturally induced fragmentation of forests. Interspecific differences within this assemblage were not due solely, or even primarily, to body size.

kadner_encoding_2008,NEUROSCIENCE,Encoding of temporal features of auditory stimuli in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body and superior paraolivary nucleus of the rat,"Neurons in the superior paraolivary nucleus (SPON) of the rat respond to the offset of pure tones with a brief burst of spikes. Medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) neurons, which inhibit the SPON, produce a sustained pure tone response followed by an offset response characterized by a period of suppressed spontaneous activity. This MNTB offset response is duration dependent and critical to the formation of SPON offset spikes [Kadner A, Kulesza RJ Jr, Berrebi AS (2006) Neurons in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body and superior paraolivary nucleus of the rat may play a role in sound duration coding. J Neurophysiol. 95:1499-1508; Kulesza RJ Jr, Kadner A, Berrebi AS (2007) Distinct roles for glycine and GABA in shaping the response properties of neurons in the superior paraolivary nucleus of the rat. J Neurophysiol 97: 1610-1620]. Here we examine the temporal resolution of the rat's MNTB/SPON circuit by assessing its capability to i) detect gaps in tones, and ii) synchronize to sinusoidally amplitude modulated (SAM) tones. Gap detection was tested by presenting two identical pure tone markers interrupted by gaps ranging from 0 to 25 ms duration. SPON neurons responded to the offset of the leading marker even when the two markers were separated only by their ramps (i.e. a 0 ms gap); longer gap durations elicited progressively larger responses. MNTB neurons produced an offset response at gap durations of 2 ms or longer, with a subset of neurons responding to 0 ms gaps. SAM tone stimuli used the unit's characteristic frequency as a carrier, and modulation rates ranged from 40 to 1160 Hz. MNTB neurons synchronized to modulation rates up to similar to 1 kHz, whereas spiking of SPON neurons decreased sharply at modulation rates 400 Hz. Modulation transfer functions based on spike count were all-pass for MNTB neurons and low-pass for SPON neurons; the modulation transfer functions based on vector strength were low-pass for both nuclei, with a steeper cutoff for SPON neurons. Thus, the MNTB/SPON circuit encodes episodes of low stimulus energy, such as gaps in pure tones and troughs in amplitude modulated tones. The output of this circuit consists of brief SPON spiking episodes; their potential effects on the auditory midbrain and forebrain are discussed. (c) 2007 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Four localities were sampled, and in each locality, three habitats were surveyed: dense forest, open forest or woodland savannah and shrub savannah. This is the first comprehensive inventory for small mammals in central Benin. We captured 794 small mammals representing twenty species (six shrew species, fourteen rodent species). Three new species that need to be described were recorded. We observed a mixture of both true forest species and of species adapted to a wider range of habitats ranging from savannah to forest clearings. Species with either Sudanian or Guinea-Congolian affinities were recorded, as well as a new species endemic to Togo and Benin. This rich biodiversity underlines the urgent need for an effective protection of these forests. The Sudanian species Crocidura cf. foxi was more abundant in Wari-Maro than in Agoua forest, while the Guineo-Congolian species Praomys misonnei and Hylomyscus sp were only captured in Agoua forest.

Arvicanthis niloticus and Mastomys erythroleucus were among the most frequently collected species (77.2\% of total capture). All rodents were examined for the presence of anti-Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) antibody; the prevalence over all sampled species was 3.8\%, varying widely with respect to species and location. Four of 14 species of rodents were found to have anti-RVFV antibodies: Rattus rattus (one positive of two tested) Mastomys huberti (13.5\%), A. niloticus (4.3\%), and M. erythroleucus (2.4\%). The highest prevalence of anti-RVFV antibody was recorded within the enzootic area of the Senegal River delta, at Richard Toll (9.6\%). A. niloticus and M. erythroleucus and a strain of laboratory-bred mice were experimentally inoculated with two strains of RVFV and examined for viremia, illness, seroconversion and mortality. A. niloticus and M. erythroleucus demonstrated a limited resistance to infection, thus potentially allowing for the replication of virus in these animals and making these species possible candidates as hosts in the maintenance cycle of RVFV in nature.

On the basis of morphological, morphometric and cytogenetic characters, we describe these animals as a new species. The distinguishing characteristics of the new species, with respect to D. melanotis and D. mystacalis from Gabon and Ghana, include the absence of a dorsal stripe and a larger body size. The new species is also smaller in size than D. oreas from Mount Cameroon. The new species has morphological similarities with karyo-typed specimens of D. messorius from Ippy (Central African Republic) and the so-called D. melanotis from La Maboke, Gabon, but has a distinct karyotype. It is close in morphology to D. messorius from the Cameroon lowlands. This is the first time G and C banding were employed for members of the genus Dendromus, and the karyotype of the new species confirms that it may be a sibling species of the D. messorius ""complex"", for which the distribution and measure of species diversity in west central Africa are far from resolved. The new species occurs in Guinean and Liberian montane savannas of Mount Nimba and in banana and quinine plantations around Mount Ziama, Guinea. It is also known from the Ivory Coast.

aniagu_anti-diarrhoeal_2005,Journal of ethnopharmacology,Anti-diarrhoeal and ulcer-protective effects of the aqueous root extract of {Guiera} senegalensis in rodents.,"The anti-diarrhoeal and ulcer-protective properties of the aqueous root extract of Guiera senegalensis, a popular herbal traditional medicine in Nigeria were investigated in rats and mice. Acute toxicity studies were also carried out. The intestinal transit in mice was significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) reduced and gastric emptying delayed. One hundred and Two hundred milligrams per kilogram (p.o.) of the extract elicited a greater anti-motility activity than 0.1 mg/kg of atropine. The extract exhibited ulcer-protective properties against ethanol-induced ulceration in rats with maximal anti-ulcer activity recorded at 100 mg/kg. Guiera senegalensis also exerted significant anti-enteropooling effects causing a dose-related inhibitory effect on castor oil-induced enteropooling in rats. A profound anti-diarrhoeal activity was observed when Guiera senegalensis was tested in diarrhoeic mice. The frequency of defaecation as well as the wetness of the faecal droppings was significantly reduced. Furthermore, the extract produced 100\% inhibition of castor oil-induced diarrhoea in mice. The oral LD50 values obtained were {\textgreater} 5000 mg/kg in both mice and rats. The results support the folkloric applications of Guiera senegalensis for the treatment of diarrhoea and ulcer in Nigerian herbal traditional medicine.",0378-8741,NA,NA

A stimulating electrode was positioned in the dorsomedial or ventrolateral aspect of the angular bundle for selective activation of the MPP and LPP, respectively. A push-pull cannula served to focally perfuse artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) across the perforant path terminal zone, while perforant path evoked potentials were monitored in the dentate hilus. Robust LTP of the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) initial slope and population spike height was induced by high frequency stimulation (400 Hz, 8 bursts of 8 pulses) applied to the medial or lateral perforant path in rats perfused with standard medium. In the lateral perforant path, a putative proenkephalin system, LTP of the EPSP and population spike was blocked when ACSF containing 100-mu-M of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone was present during the tetanus, while perfusion with 0.1-mu-M naloxone prevented EPSP potentiation but only reduced the magnitude of the population spike increase. Naloxone had no effect on LTP induction in the MPP. Importantly, 0.1-mu-M ICI 174,864, a selective antagonist of delta-opioid receptors, blocked LTP of synaptic transmission in the LPP while leaving the population spike increase intact. The results indicate that LTP of synaptic transmission in the LPP requires activation of delta-opioid receptors, while `non-delta' opioid receptors may be involved in augmenting granule cell output. This opioid receptor-dependent LTP illustrates peptidergic regulation of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.",0006-8993,NA,10.1016/0006-8993(91)91433-2

The molecular basis for the synergy is unknown. Here, we investigated this potentiated transmitter release (PTR) phenomenon at the single cell level by monitoring catecholamine (CA) release in chromaffin cells using amperometry. We found that the 60 mM KCI (K60)-triggered release in bovine chromaffin cells synergizes with bradykinin (BK) or histamine (Hist) to potentiate CA release. PTR was independent of Ca(2+) influx through voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), but required Ca(2+) at the extracellular medium and was abolished by inhibitors of phospholipase C beta (PLC beta). The similar to four-fold PTR induced in mouse chromaffin cells by BK and K60, was not observed in chromaffin cells prepared from TRPC1 KO mice and was restored by expressing hTRPC1. The synergy between strong voltage perturbation (K60) in the presence of VGCC blockers, and the activation of the G(q/11)-PLC beta signal-transduction cascade generates unique and fundamental amplified signaling machinery. The concerted activation of two independent cellular pathways could reinforce physiological signals that impinge on regulation of secretory events during repeated sequence of high-frequency excitation, hyperpolarization, and relief of inhibition such as long-term potentiation (LTP), that lead to neuronal synaptic plasticity.

The animals were captured during phases of sexual activity or inactivity and were maintained in the laboratory for 50 days under humid conditions (water-rich diet, 90\% atmospheric relative humidity) or dry conditions (water-deficient diet, 20\% atmospheric relative humidity) and at low temperatures (20-25-degrees-C) or high temperatures (30-35-degrees-C). The results show that humid conditions or low temperatures stimulate testicular activity in Arvicanthis niloticus whereas dry conditions or high temperatures inhibit breeding. 1) Humid conditions coupled with low temperatures caused the most marked stimulation of testicular activity and maintained sexual activity at its highest level. 2) Humid conditions coupled with high temperatures, or dry conditions coupled with low temperatures, brought about mild sexual activity in animals that were sexually inactive and a regression of testicular weight and plasma testosterone in animals that were sexually active at the beginning of the experiment. In the latter, the results show that testicular activity was maintained and animals remained capable of breeding. 3) High temperatures and dry conditions inhibited short-day gonadal stimulation. On the other hand, in animals maintained under humid conditions or at low temperatures, gonadal stimulation occurred only under a short photoperiod. In animals captured in Burkina Faso, the gonado-facilitating effect of low temperature and humidity, observed in animals maintained on a short-day regimen (11L:13D), was considerably weaker in animals maintained on a long-day regimen (12.5L:11.5D). The results are discussed in relation to the annual cycle of testicular activity in Arvicanthis niloticus living in natural habitats. These findings show that annual variations in day length play an important role in controlling testicular activity in this species but that ambient temperature and water conditions are also involved in controlling the length of the breeding period.",0006-3363,NA,10.1095/biolreprod49.4.716
romanovsky_organum_2003,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-REGULATORY INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY,The organum vasculosum laminae terminalis in immune-to-brain febrigenic signaling: a reappraisal of lesion experiments,"The organum vasculosum laminae terminalis (OVLT) has been proposed to serve as the interface for blood-to-brain febrigenic signaling, because ablation of this structure affects the febrile response. However, lesioning the OVLT causes many â€œside effectsâ€  not fully accounted for in the fever literature. By placing OVLT-lesioned rats on intensive rehydration therapy, we attempted to prevent these side effects and to evaluate the febrile response in their absence. After the OVLT of Sprague-Dawley rats was lesioned electrolytically, the rats were given access to 5\% sucrose for 1 wk to stimulate drinking. Sucrose consumption and body mass were monitored. The animals were examined twice a day for signs of dehydration and treated with isotonic saline ( 50 ml/kg sc) when indicated. This protocol eliminated mortality but not several acute and chronic side effects stemming from the lesion. The acute effects included adipsia and gross (14\% of body weight) emaciation; chronic effects included hypernatremia, hyperosmolality, a suppressed drinking response to hypertonic saline, and previously unrecognized marked (by similar to2 degreesC) and long- lasting ({\textgreater}3 wk) hyperthermia. Because the hyperthermia was not accompanied by tail skin vasoconstriction, it likely reflected increased thermogenesis. After the rats recovered from the acute ( but not chronic) side effects, their febrile response to IL-1beta (500 ng/ kg iv) was tested. The sham-operated rats developed typical monophasic fevers (similar to0.5 degreesC), the lesioned rats did not. However, the absence of the febrile response in the OVLT-lesioned rats likely resulted from the untreatable side effects. For example, hyperthermia at the time of pyrogen injection was high enough (39 - 40 degreesC) to solely prevent fever from developing. Hence, the changed febrile responsiveness of OVLT-lesioned animals is given an alternative interpretation, unrelated to febrigenic signaling to the brain.",0363-6119,NA,10.1152/ajpregu.00757.2002
fakae_heligmosomoides_1999,VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY,Heligmosomoides polygyrus and {Trypanosoma} congolense infections in mice: effect of immunisation by abbreviated larval infection,"Concurrent African trypanosome and gastrointestinal helminth infections are prevalent in subhumid savannah where they are endemic. However, acquired resistance in animals varies with their responder status and exposure. As a guide to study in the definitive hosts, the effects of Trypanosoma congolense infection on the development and maintenance of homologous Heligmosomoides polygyrus resistance were investigated in outbred TO mice. These mice were immunised by abbreviation of larval infection. Immune or naive mice were either infected with 500 infective larvae (L-3) of H. polygyrus and/or 10(4) bloodstream forms of T. congolense or were not infected. The outcome of infection was monitored by routine parasitological and immunological techniques for 30 days after the day of the T. congolense infection. Significantly more immune mice concurrently infected with both parasites survived than did immune mice in which H. polygyrus was superimposed on a 10-day-old T. congolense infection. Although all the mice in this latter group died before the end of the experiment, larval immunisation prolonged their survival, relative to similarly treated naive mice. The antibody titres to H. polygyrus in the sera of immune mice challenged with H. polygyrus alone were significantly higher than those of immune mice concurrently infected with both parasites but the levels of protection obtained were comparable. It is concluded that T. congolense may not completely block the strong acquired resistance induced by abbreviated H. polygyrus larval infection in TO mice but is capable of interfering with protective responses, especially if the trypanosome infection occurs prior to H. polygyrus challenge infection.

The endothelial adenine nucleotides of Langendorff-perfused rat hearts were prelabelled by perfusion with [H-3]adenosine and the changes in specific radioactivities were employed to identify the source of the adenine compounds released. The contribution of ecto-5'-nucleotidase was evaluated in perfusions with the inhibitor alpha,beta-methylene adenosine diphosphate (AOPCP). Absorbance of the effluent perfusate at 260nm was monitored continuously as a convenient means of detecting the output of total purines, and it showed a good correlation with HPLC-measured purines (r=0.72, P {\textless} 0.001). Coronary Bow increased sharply in hypoxia but tended to decrease after 2 min, while effluent radiaoctivity and absorbance increased steadily. The radioactivity-to-absorbance ratio and the specific radioactivity of chemically measured total purines began to increase after 3 min. The changes in effluent concentrations of adenosine and inosine were much more prominent than those in free purines. The specific radioactivity of adenosine decreased sharply at the onset of hypoxia which indicates that hypoxia affects mainly working cardiomyocytes. This also means that endothelial adenosine release is delayed if compared to coronary vasoregulation. Although the inhibition of ecto-5'-nucleotidase caused a decrease in the release of adenosine and adenine moiety label from the heart it is most likely that adenosine was mainly derived from intracellular sources, because the hypoxia-induced increase in the concentration of adenosine was more excessive than that of AMP. In addition, AOPCP decreased the basal work load and coronary now of the heart, slightly attenuated the hypoxia-induced Bow increase and prevented adenylate loss during hypoxia. Thus, the data emphasize the role of cardiomyocytes in adenosine production and coronary vasoregulation.",0022-2828,NA,10.1006/jmcc.1994.1127

The allergenic activity of this compound was tested on mice using the local lymph node assay, and further evaluated on guinea pigs using the Freund's complete adjuvant test. Using these methods, hydroperoxide 7 was found to be a strong sensitizer. Radical-trapping experiments were carried out on this compound in the presence of the spin-trapping agent, 1,1,3,3-tetramethylisoindolin-2-yloxyl 17, using light to induce radicals. The formation of carbon-centered radicals derived from compound 7 by intramolecular cyclization of an oxygen-centered radical was observed. The reaction of these intermediates with 17 gave various adducts in a very low yield, but a 1/1 mixture of diastereomers 18a and 18b (0.1\% yield) was isolated and characterized, together with compound 19 (0.03\% yield). The results suggest that carbon-centered reactive radicals are formed from allylic hydroperoxides and that this could be the possible mechanism involved in allergic contact dermatitis to abietic acid.",0893-228X,NA,10.1021/tx9901433

marien_evaluation_2019,Emerging microbes \& infections,Evaluation of rodent control to fight {Lassa} fever based on field data and mathematical modelling.,"The Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis) is the reservoir host of Lassa virus, an arenavirus that causes Lassa haemorrhagic fever in humans in West Africa. Because no vaccine exists and therapeutic options are limited, preventing infection through rodent control and human behavioural measures is currently considered to be the only option. In order to assess the efficacy of rodent control, we performed a 4-year field experiment in rural Upper Guinea and developed a mathematical model to simulate different control strategies (annual density control, continuous density control, and rodent vaccination). For the field study, rodenticide baits were placed each year in three rural villages, while three other villages were used as controls. Rodents were trapped before and after every treatment and their antibody status and age were determined. Data from the field study were used to parameterize the mathematical model. In the field study, we found a significant negative effect of rodent control on seroprevalence, but this effect was small especially given the effort. Furthermore, the rodent populations recovered rapidly after rodenticide application, leading us to conclude that an annual control strategy is unlikely to significantly reduce Lassa virus spillover to humans. In agreement with this finding, the mathematical model suggests that the use of continuous control or rodent vaccination is the only strategy that could lead to Lassa virus elimination. These field and model results can serve as a guide for determining how long and frequent rodent control should be done in order to eliminate Lassa virus in rural villages.",2222-1751,NA,10.1080/22221751.2019.1605846
schwan_fleas_2016,Parasites \& Vectors,Fleas and trypanosomes of peridomestic small mammals in sub-{Saharan} {Mali}.,"Background: Fleas are obligate blood-feeding ectoparasites and vectors of several bacterial zoonotic pathogens as well as trypanosomes that parasitize rodents and other small mammals. During investigations of tick-and rodent-borne diseases in Mali, West Africa, we included fleas and rodent-borne trypanosomes, both of which are poorly known in this country, but are attracting greater public health interest. Methods: Small mammals were captured in 20 Malian villages from December 2007 to October 2011. Fleas were collected and identified to species, and thin blood smears were prepared, stained and examined microscopically for trypanosomes. Results: We captured 744 small mammals, 68 (9.1 \%) of which yielded fleas. Two species of fleas, Xenopsylla cheopis and Xenopsylla nubica, were collected from six species of rodents and one species of shrew. Multimammate rats, Mastomys natalensis, were hosts for 58.5 \% of all fleas collected. Xenopsylla cheopis was found in the moister southern savannah while X. nubica was mostly restricted to the drier Sahel. Trypanosomes were found in 3 \% of 724 blood smears, although 91 \% of parasitemic animals originated from two villages where black rats (Rattus rattus) and M. natalensis were the primary hosts and X. cheopis the dominant flea. The trypanosomes were morphologically consistent with the Trypanosoma (Herpetosoma) lewisi group, flea-borne hemoflagellates that parasitize domestic rats. Conclusions: Xenopsylla cheopis and trypanosomes parasitize peridomestic rats that commingle with people in southern Mali. Given the increasing awareness of flea-borne trypanosomes as possible human pathogens, we hope our findings will stimulate future investigators to examine the potential public health significance of flea-borne trypanosomosis in West Africa.",1756-3305,NA,NA
farombi_municipal_2012,Toxicology and industrial health,Municipal landfill leachate induces hepatotoxicity and oxidative stress in rats.,"Human beings are more often exposed to complex mixtures of hazardous chemicals than single toxicant. The present study investigated the effects of Olushosun municipal landfill leachate (OMLL) from Ojota in Lagos State of Nigeria on hepatic function and some biomarkers of oxidative stress in adult rats. Physicochemical characteristic analysis of OMLL showed that while total alkalinity, total acidity, total hardness, biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand were 3-fold, 2-fold, 4-fold and 1-fold, respectively, concentrations of heavy metals analysis showed that copper, lead, cadmium, arsenic, cobalt, chromium and mercury were 9-fold, 4-fold, 21-fold, 1320-fold, 7-fold, 5-fold and 4-fold, respectively, higher than acceptable limits by regulatory authorities. The OMLL was administered at 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40\% concentrations to adult male rats for 14 days. Following exposure, serum was collected for serum biochemistry assays and liver was collected to determine the antioxidant status. Exposure of animals to 10, 20, 30 and 40\% OMLL resulted in 3\%, 31\%, 52\% and 83\% increase in aspartate aminotransferase activity, whereas it elevated alanine aminotransferase activity by 10\%, 25\%, 30\% and 49\%, respectively, when compared with the control. While OMLL administration significantly increased catalase activity, a sequential decrease in reduced glutathione level and in superoxide dismutase and glutathione-S-transferase activities with concomitant increase in malondialdehyde level were observed, when compared with the control. Collectively, the hepatotoxicity of OMLL could be due to the induction of oxidative stress and may suggest possible health hazards in subjects with occupational or environmental exposure.",1477-0393,NA,10.1177/0748233711416947

Spermatogenic efficiency, reported as the ratios among germ cells (spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes and round spermatids) and by the ratio of germ cells to Sertoli cells, was not associated with testosterone levels. However, Leydig cell parameters such as number of Leydig cells per gram of testis, total number of Leydig cells per testis and percent cell volume of Leydig cell nuclei were correlated significantly with testosterone levels. The statistically significant correlation (r = 0.82, P{\textless}0.05) observed between testosterone levels and the number of Leydig cells per gram of testis suggests that, in the rabbit, the latter parameter can serve as a criterion for monitoring testosterone levels in this species under normal conditions.",0100-879X,NA,10.1590/S0100-879X2002000400014
mohankumar_effects_2000,NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS,Effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharide on central monoamines and fever in the rat: involvement of the vagus,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is known to produce a number of central and neuroendocrine effects but the mechanisms involved are still unclear. This study was done to investigate the possibility that LPS-induced fever and activation of central monoamines are mediated through the vagus. Adult-male rats were subjected to sub-diaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV), or sham operation and treated with saline or LPS in saline (10 mu g/kg bw) 2 h later. Rectal temperature was monitored at half-hourly intervals for 5 h after which the animals were sacrificed and monoamine concentrations in hypothalamic nuclei were measured using HPLC-EC. SDV delayed the rise in rectal temperature induced by LPS by 1 h when compared to Sham animals. It also increased the concentrations of monoamines in the paraventricular nucleus of both Sham and SDV rats. This indicates that routes other than the vagus probably mediate LPS' actions on the central nervous system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

We used Western blotting and immunohistochemical methods to examine the level and localization of GABA(B)R2, a required subunit of a functional GABA(B) receptor, in the rat's central auditory system. Results revealed that this subunit was expressed throughout the auditory system with the level being high in the layers I-V of the auditory cortex, medial geniculate nucleus, dorsomedial and lateral parts of the inferior colliculus, and the molecular and fusiform cell layers of the dorsal cochlear nucleus. Labeled cell bodies were found in all the areas showing immunoreactivity. Neuropil labeling was strong in areas with high overall levels of immunoreactivity. Regional distributions of the receptor subunit revealed clear boundaries of some auditory subnuclei including the dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei and the lateral superior olivary nucleus. Differences in immunoreactivity were found between the central nucleus and the dorsal cortex of the inferior colliculus and between the dorsal and ventral parts of the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, although no clear boundaries were observed. No differences in immunoreactivity were found between the core and the belt areas of the auditory cortex and among the subdivisions of the medial geniculate nucleus.

bair-brake_is_2014,Zoonoses and public health,Is that a rodent in your luggage? {A} mixed method approach to describe bushmeat importation into the {United} {States}.,"Bushmeat, defined as meat derived from wild animals, is a potential source of zoonotic pathogens. Bushmeat from restricted animals is illegal to import into the United States under US federal regulations. We reviewed US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) port of entry surveillance records from September 2005 through December 2010 and conducted focus group studies to describe trends in and reasons for bushmeat importation into the United States. In total, 543 confiscated bushmeat items were recorded. Half of the confiscated bushmeat items identified were rodents. Africa was the most frequent continent of origin. Seasonality was evident, with bushmeat confiscations peaking in late spring to early summer. Four times more bushmeat was confiscated during an enhanced surveillance period in June 2010 compared with the same period in previous years, suggesting that routine surveillance underestimated the amount of bushmeat detected at US Ports of Entry. Focus groups held in three major US cities revealed that bushmeat importation is a multifaceted issue. Longstanding cultural practices of hunting and eating bushmeat make it difficult for consumers to acknowledge potential health and ecologic risks. Also, US merchants selling African goods, including bushmeat, in their stores have caused confusion among importers as to whether importation is truly illegal. Enhancing routine surveillance for bushmeat and consistent enforcement of penalties at all ports of entry, along with health education aimed at bushmeat importers, might be useful to deter illegal importation.

Rabbits exhibited the highest concentrations, followed by guinea pigs, humans and rats. There was no significant difference between germ-free rats and control rats. The authenticity of NO was confirmed in cold-trap experiments. Intravenous administration of inhibitors of NO synthase (0.01-300 mg kg(-1)) to guinea pigs dose dependently reduced NO concentrations in exhaled air with the following potency order: L-N-omega-nitro-arginine-methylester {\textgreater} asymmetric N-G,N-G-dimethyl-L-arginine-dihydrochloride = L-N-G-mono-methyl -arginine = L-N-5-(1-iminoethyl)-ornithine = aminoguanidine {\textgreater} L-canavanine. The effect of the NO synthase inhibitors was partly or fully reversed by L-arginine (1 g kg(-1) i.v.), and L-arginine per se induced a significant increment of NO in exhaled air. In rats, L-N-omega-nitro-arginine-methylester was considerably less potent than in guinea pigs. The concentration of NO in exhaled air increased 3-fold when changing from in situ blood auto-perfusion of rabbit lungs to in situ perfusion with saline medium. Addition of L-N-omega-nitro-arginine-methylester to the saline perfusion medium evoked a reduction of NO concentrations in the air from the ventilated perfused lungs. Perfusion of lungs with Ca2+-free medium induced significant decrements in NO concentrations in exhaled air, an effect partly reversed upon reintroducing Ca2+ into the medium. In conclusion, NO was detected in exhaled air from humans and animals by chemiluminescence. Nitric oxide in exhaled air originates from the respiratory system and is formed from L-arginine in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Microbial activity is not necessary for formation of NO in the respiratory system.",0014-2999,NA,10.1016/0014-2999(94)90629-7
lukashevich_lassa_2019,F1000Research,Lassa virus diversity and feasibility for universal prophylactic vaccine.,"Lassa virus (LASV) is a highly prevalent mammarenavirus in West Africa and is maintained in nature in a persistently infected rodent host, Mastomys natalensis, which is widely spread in sub-Saharan Africa. LASV infection of humans can cause Lassa fever (LF), a disease associated with high morbidity and significant mortality. Recent evidence indicates an LASV expansion outside its traditional endemic areas. In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) included LASV in top-priority pathogens and released a Target Product Profile (TPP) for vaccine development. Likewise, in 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration added LF to a priority review voucher program to encourage the development of preventive and therapeutics measures. In this article, we review recent progress in LASV vaccine research and development with a focus on the impact of LASV genetic and biological diversity on the design and development of vaccine candidates meeting the WHO's TPP for an LASV vaccine.",2046-1402,NA,10.12688/f1000research.16989.1

Bifidobacterium magnum (Bif) isolated from CV guinea-pigs was used for pretreatment. The mortality of LF guinea-pigs inoculated with only Bif was 75\%, and that of those inoculated with Bif plus chloroform-treated cecal suspension (CHF) or Bif plus CHF plus 32 isolates from CV guinea-pigs was 40 to 66. 7\%. These three groups were in an unhealthy condition with mucoid enteritis-like diarrhea. However, the mortality of LF guinea-pigs inoculated with the anaerobic growth on EG plates injected with 10(-5) dilution of cecal contents (CF) or inoculated with Bif plus CF was 6.3 and 15\%, respectively. These latter two groups of LF guinea-pigs were transferred to separate barrier rooms and some of the LF guinea-pigs were maintained in isolators as a source of intestinal flora for SPF guinea-pigs. The composition of cecal flora of LF guinea-pigs was stable for a long time, and bacteroidaceae and peptococcaceae were maintained as predominant components. The basic composition of the cecal flora of SPF guinea-pigs originated from LF guinea-pigs, which consists mainly of the anaerobic bacteria, was not changed over a long period, and the flora composition became similar to that in CV guinea-pigs. Guinea-pig-specific pathogens from the SPF colonies were not defected during experiments.",1341-1357,NA,10.1538/expanim.50.105

laing_immunization_1993,Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,Immunization against {Echis} ocellatus (carpet viper) venom using liposomes incorporating immunostimulants: role of lipopolysaccharide in conferring protection in a mouse model.,"Varying doses of whole West African Echis ocellatus venom were incorporated, with or without immunostimulants, into membrane-stabilized reverse phase evaporation (REV) liposomes. Preparations were given either subcutaneously (s.c.) or intravenously (i.v.) to mice and the immune responses compared. Addition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) significantly increased the venom antibody response. Lipid A produced a less pronounced and less sustained effect and the addition of muramyl dipeptide analogues made no significant contribution to the antibody response. The protective ability of circulating venom antibodies was assessed by challenging the immunized mice with a minimum lethal dose of whole venom after 175 days. A dose of 250 micrograms E. ocellatus venom + 300 micrograms LPS in REVs injected s.c. conferred the highest protection against lethal venom effects. Orally administered venom/liposomes incorporated with the mucosal adjuvant avridine primed the antibody response and produced a classic secondary response following a sublethal boost of whole venom. Single injections of venom or venom fraction/liposome preparations which produce a high and sustained immune response have potential in commercial antivenom production and in active immunization of man in areas of high snakebite incidence and mortality.",0041-0101,NA,NA
wen_protective_2017,BRAIN RESEARCH,Protective effect of propofol on noise-induced hearing loss,"Purpose: Iatrogenic noise produced by mastoid or craniotomy drills may cause hearing damage, which is induced by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the reduction of cochlear blood flow (CoBF). This study investigated whether propofol could reduce noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in a guinea pig model. Methods: Sixty-four male pigmented guinea pigs were randomly and equally divided into 4 groups: control, noise, propofol and propofol + noise. Propofol was infused intravenously for 20 min prior to noise exposure with a loading dose of 5 mg.kg(-1) for 5 min and a maintenance infusion of 20 mg.kg(-1).h(-1) for 135 min. For noise exposure, an octave band noise at a 124 dB sound pressure level (SPL) was administered to animals for 2 h. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and CoBF were monitored continuously. Auditory function was measured by the level of distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) before and at 1 h, 72 h and 240 h after noise exposure. Cochlear levels of 8-iso-Prostaglandin F-2alpha (8-iso-PGF2 alpha) were measured immediately after the termination of noise exposure. Cochlear silver nitrate staining and outer hair cell (OHC) counting were performed after the final functional test. Results: Noise exposure caused decreases in the CoBF and DPOAE amplitudes, over-generation of 8-iso-PGF2 alpha and the loss of OHCs. Pre-treatment with propofol significantly increased the CoBF and DPOAE amplitudes, decreased 8-iso-PGF2 alpha and the loss of OHCs. Conclusions: Propofol exerted protective effects against NIHL in this animal model by suppressing a lipid peroxidation reaction and improving CoBF. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

la_cour_regional_2006,MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY,Regional differences in the coupling of 5-hydroxytryptamine-{1A} receptors to {G} proteins in the rat brain,"Numerous data showed that 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A (5-HT1A) receptors couple to G alpha(o)/alpha(i) proteins for signal transduction. However, the alpha subunit isoforms really involved in 5-HT1A receptor coupling in brain remain to be identified. Moreover, regional differences in the functional characteristics of brain 5-HT1A receptors have been evidenced repeatedly. Because such differences could be due to variations in G proteins interacting with the same receptor, relevant approaches were used for identifying alpha subunits physically coupled to 5-HT1A receptors in different regions of the rat brain. Using immunoaffinity chromatography coupled to Western blot detection, 5-HT1A receptors were found to interact equally with G alpha(o) and G alpha(i3) in the cerebral cortex, mainly with G alpha(o) and weakly with G alpha(i3) in the hippocampus and exclusively with G alpha(i3) in the anterior raphe area. In the hypothalamus, 5-HT1A receptors seemed to be coupled to the latter two G proteins plus G alpha(i1) and G alpha(z). Complementary experiments based on an antibody capture technique coupled to both classic radioactivity and scintillation proximity assay detections showed that hippocampal 5-HT1A receptor stimulation induced 5'-O-(3-[S-35] thio) triphosphate binding to immunoprecipitates with G alpha(i3) and G alpha(o) antisera. In the anterior raphe, such 5-HT1A receptor-mediated effect was obtained with G alpha(i3) antiserum only. These results demonstrated the existence of regional differences in the coupling of 5-HT1A receptors to G proteins in the rat brain. In the anterior raphe, 5-HT1A receptors seem to interact specifically with G alpha(i3), whereas in the hippocampus, they are mainly coupled to G alpha(o) proteins. Such a disparity in G-protein coupling might explain regional differences in adaptive regulations of brain 5-HT1A receptors.",0026-895X,NA,10.1124/mol.106.022756

To assess OA-related changes in mean compartmental femorotibial cartilage thickness in rat knees by three-dimensional (3D) MRI (7T). Methods. MRI was performed in vivo at 7T on OA and untouched contralateral knee joints. Gradient Echo Fast Imaging 3D MR images were acquired sequentially in surgically induced OA (D0) in 40 Wistar rats (anterior cruciate ligament transection). Mean femoral (trochlear, lateral and medial) and tibial (lateral and medial) cartilage thicknesses were quantified from a 2D MRI slide in weight-bearing areas and from a 3D MRI data set. At each time-point [Day (D) 8, D14, D21, D40 and D60], eight animals (16 knees) were sacrificed for concomitant histomorphometry. Results. As body weight dramatically increased throughout the experiment (+150\%, baseline vs endpoint), all compartmental mean cartilage thicknesses noticeably decreased (D8, D14) and then remained relatively stable. Femoral compartments in OA knees were thinner at the end of the experiment than in contralateral age-matched knees. Conversely, lateral and medial tibial cartilages were thicker than controls. Histological correlation was significant only in untouched healthy cartilages (3D better than 2D). Conclusions. 3D MRI (7T) enables in vivo monitoring of compartmental changes in OA-related femorotibial rat cartilage thickness vs contralateral age-matched knees.",1462-0324,NA,10.1093/rheumatology/keq154

It is well-known that in mammals, cytochrome P450 (P450 or CYP) monooxygenases metabolize lipophilic foreign compounds. These P450 species are inducible, and both CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 are induced by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) combined with a ligand. Gene engineering of P450 and NADPH cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (P450 reductase) was established for bioconversion. Also, gene modification of AhRs was developed for recombinant AhR-mediated beta-glucronidase (GUS) reporter assay of AhR ligands. Recombinant P450 genes were transformed into plants for phytoremediation, and recombinant AhR-mediated GUS reporter gene expression systems were each transformed into plants for phytomonitoring. Transgenic rice plants carrying CYP2B6 metabolized the herbicide metolachlor and remarkably reduced the residues in the plants and soils under paddy field conditions. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants carrying recombinant guinea pig (g) AhR-mediated GUS reporter genes detected PCB126 at the level of 10 ng/g soils in the presence of biosurfactants MEL-B.

gronhaug_bioactive_2010,Glycobiology,Bioactive arabinogalactans from the leaves of {Opilia} celtidifolia {Endl}. ex {Walp}. ({Opiliaceae}).,"The leaves of the tree Opilia celtidifolia have a long tradition for being used in Mali and other West African countries against various ailments such as for wound healing. Previous studies on polysaccharides from these leaves showed the presence of pectic-like polymers with an effect on the human complement system as well as the ability to activate macrophages. The present study shows that bioactive arabinogalactans isolated by water of 50degreeC could be separated into two acidic fractions, Oc50A1 and Oc50A2. The former could, by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-400, be separated into two fractions, which were further purified on a Superdex 200 column to give the fractions Oc50A1.I.pur and Oc50A1.II.pur. These fractions were subjected to chemical and biological studies. The polysaccharides consisted mainly of heavily branched type II arabinogalactans and minor amounts of rhamnogalacturonan I regions. The isolated polymers had a high human complement-fixating ability, as well as the ability to stimulate rat macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) and to induce B cell proliferation. These effects were especially pronounced for the higher molecular weight fraction of Oc50A1.I.pur. The fractions Oc50A1.I.pur and Oc501.II.pur stimulated secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines from purified B cells or DCs. Collectively, these results indicate that the arabinogalactan type II polymers present in the leaves of O. celtidifolia may be used to develop medical devices for regulating inflammatory processes.",1460-2423,NA,10.1093/glycob/cwq120

Technologia alimentaria,Haematological and biochemical studies on {Justicia} carnea leaves extract in phenylhydrazine induced-anemia in albino rats.,"BACKGROUND: Justicia carnea is a medicinal plant used widely in Nigeria which is reported to have diverse functions, including blood-boosting potential. Aim. The effect of the ethanol extract of Justicea carnea (JC) leaves in phenylhydrazine induced-anemia albino rats on haematological and lipid profile parameters was investigated., METHODS: The experimental animals were randomly grouped into five groups of six rats each â€“ group 1 (non-anemic control), group 2 (anemic control), group 3 (500 mg/kg of JC extract), group 4 (1000 mg/kg of JC extract) and group 5 (DMSO control). Phenylhydrazine was administered once at a dose of 80 mg/kg b.w. to induce hemolytic anemia. After 28 days of extract administration, they were humanely sacrificed and the serum collected was used for biochemical analysis., RESULTS: In the acute toxicity study, the LD50 was found to be above 5000 mg/kg body weight. Packed Cell Volume (PCV) values, Red Blood cell (RBC) and haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations decreased (p {\textless} 0.05) sig- nificantly after 48 hours of phenylhydrazine induction, but after 28 days of administering extracts of Justicia carnea, PCV values, RBC and Hb increased (p {\textless} 0.05) significantly. There were significant (p {\textless} 0.05) de- creases in cholesterol, triacylglycerol, and LDL cholesterol concentrations in the extract-administered groups (groups 3\&4) relative to the anemic control. There was a significant (p {\textless} 0.05) increase in HDL-cholesterol concentrations in the extract groups (3\&4) relative to the non-anemic control., CONCLUSIONS: Extracts of Justicia carnea not only reversed anemic conditions in the phenylhydrazine-induced rats, it also improved the lipid profile, and this may be attributed to its rich phytochemical, nutrient and vita- min composition. Therefore, the findings of the study suggest that J. carnea leaves could be used to manage lipid abnormalities associated with anemia.",1898-9594,NA,10.17306/J.AFS.0492
abgottspon_development_2010,JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGICAL METHODS,Development of an aggregation assay to screen {FimH} antagonists,"alpha-D-Mannopyranosides are potent FimH antagonists, which inhibit the adhesion of Escherichia coli to highly mannosylated uroplakin la on the urothelium and therefore offer an efficient therapeutic opportunity for the treatment and prevention of urinary tract infection. For the evaluation of the therapeutic potential of FimH antagonists, their effect on the disaggregation of E. coli from Candida albicans and guinea pig erythrocytes (GPE) was studied. The mannose-specific binding of E. coli to yeast cells and erythrocytes is mediated by type 1 pili and can be monitored by aggregometry. Maximal aggregation of C. albicans or GPE to E. coli is reached after 600 s. Then the FimH antagonist was added and disaggregation determined by light transmission over a period of 1400 s. A FimH-deleted mutant of E coli. which does not induce any aggregation, was used in a control experiment. The activities of FimH antagonists are expressed as IC(50)s, the half maximal inhibitory concentration of the disaggregation potential. n-Heptyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside (1) was used as a reference compound and exhibits an IC50 of 77.14 mu M, whereas methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside (2) does not lead to any disaggregation at concentrations up to 800 mu M. o-Chloro-p-[N-(2-ethoxy-3,4-dioxocyclobut-1-enyl)amino]phenyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside (3) shows a 90-fold and 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside (4) a 6-fold increased affinity compared to 1. Finally. 4-nitrophenyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside (5) exhibits an activity similar to 1. As negative control, D-galactose (6) was used. The standardized aggregation assay generates concentration-dependent, reproducible data allowing the evaluation of FimH antagonists according to their potency to inhibit E. coli adherence and can therefore be employed to select candidates for experimental and clinical studies for treatment and prevention of urinary tract infections.

accardi_rat_2016,JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGICAL AND TOXICOLOGICAL METHODS,Rat cardiovascular telemetry: {Marginal} distribution applied to positive control drugs,"Cardiovascular effects are considered frequent during drug safety testing. This investigation aimed to characterize the pharmacological response of the conscious telemetered rat in vivo model to known cardiovascular active agents. These effects were analyzed using statistical analysis and cloud representation with marginal distribution curves for the contractility index and heart rate as to assess the effect relationship between cardiac variables. Arterial blood pressure, left ventricular pressure, electrocardiogram and body temperature were monitored. The application of data cloud with marginal distribution curves to heart rate and contractility index provided an interesting tactic during the interpretation of drug-induced changes particularly during selective time resolution (i.e. marginal distribution curves restricted to T-max). Taken together, the present data suggests that marginal distribution curves can be a valuable interpretation strategy when using the rat cardiovascular telemetry model to detect drug-induced cardiovascular effects. Marginal distribution curves could also be considered during the interpretation of other inter-dependent parameters in safety pharmacology studies. (C) 2016 The Authors.

G. Don (Leguminosae) is among the plants commonly used in the traditional management of diabetes mellitus in Nigeria and Togo. Aim of the study: This study investigated the anti-diabetic activity of the butanol fraction of P. biglobosa leaves (PBBF) in a type 2 diabetes (T2D) model of rats and a possible bioactive compound in the fraction. Materials and methods: T2D was induced by feeding rats with a 10\% fructose solution ad libitum for two weeks followed by an intraperitoneal injection of 40 mg/kg body weight streptozotocin and the animals were orally treated with 150 and 300 mg/kg BW of the PBBF for five days in a week. Another group of rats was non-diabetic but similarly administered with 300 mg/kg BW of the PBBF. Food and fluid intakes, body weight changes and blood glucose levels were monitored during the experiment while other relevant diabetes-associated parameters were measured at the end of the experiment. Results: The PBBF treatments significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) decreased the blood glucose levels and improved the glucose tolerance ability compared to untreated diabetic rats. Furthermore, the treatments were found to improve pancreatic beta cell function (HOMA-beta), stimulate insulin secretions, decrease insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), restore liver glycogen, ameliorate serum dyslipidaemia and prevent hepatic and renal damages compared to untreated diabetic rats. Phytochemical analysis of the fraction led to the isolation of lupeol which inhibited alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase in non-competitive and uncompetitive inhibition patterns respectively. Conclusion: It was concluded that PBBF possessed remarkable anti T2D activity which is mediated through modulation of beta-cell function and stimulation of insulin secretion and the lower dose (150 mg/kg BW) was found optimum for anti-T2D activity compared to the high dose (300 mg/kg BW) in this study.

Guinea pigs were also sensitized to OVA intraperitoneally and subcutaneously with a 100 mg/ml solution of saline containing 5 mg of Al(OH)(3) as an adjuvant. Six weeks after the initial allergen stimulation, systemic and local anaphylaxis as elicited by 1-min aerosol administration of a nebulizer and monitored by macroscopic vision accompanied by a time trial for respiratory and cardiac arrest. Serum antibody levels were tested by passive hemagglutination as well as passive cutaneous anaphylaxis especially for the estimation of IgE levels. Nasal, tonsillar and bronchial tissues were also prepared and fixed, followed by hematoxylin and eosin staining for histological observation. In the offspring of mothers who had been stimulated with optimal amounts of the allergen and had fully developed specific antibodies against the allergen, there was a clear-cut suppression in the development of a specific respiratory allergy over a significant period after delivery. The effect was confirmed by systemic and local anaphylaxis, eosinophil infiltration, ciliary deformation in nasal mucosae and the tonsillar site in the complex interaction of various cell types and mediators eliciting the clinical respiratory symptoms, in particular nasal hypersensitivity. In a different experimental model, the mouse model, these biological findings were not regulated by maternal transferable antibody or antigen fragments from the mother. The induction of suppressor T cell (CD4(+)) in offspring depends on the recognition of the antigens presented in association with the same MHC haplotype as that utilized in the maternal T cell response during pregnancy. These results suggest the presence of suppression mechanisms in the offspring of mothers stimulated during pregnancy. From these results, we discuss the mechanisms for suppression and protective efficacy for respiratory allergy as well as possible side effects in the young of mothers stimulated during pregnancy.",0001-6489,NA,NA
buras_changes_2006,JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY,Changes in glycine immunoreactivity in the rat superior olivary complex following deafness,"The balance between inhibitory and excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters contributes to the control of normal functioning of the auditory brainstem. Changes in the level of neuronal activity within the auditory brainstem pathways influence the balance between inhibition and excitation. Activity-dependent plasticity in the auditory pathways can be studied by creating a large decrease in activity through peripheral deafening. Deafness-related decreases in GABA have previously been shown in the inferior colliculus. However, glycine is a more prevalent inhibitory transmitter in the mature superior olivary complex (SOC). The present study therefore examined if there were deafness-related changes in glycine in the SOC using postembedding immunocytochemistry. Animals were bilaterally deafened by an intrascalar injection of neomycin. Five nuclei in the SOC, the lateral superior olive (LSO), superior paraolivary nucleus (SPoN), and the medial, lateral, and ventral nuclei of the trapezoid body (MNTB, LNTB, and VNTB) were examined 14 days following the deafening and compared to normal hearing age-matched controls. The LSO and SPoN were divided into high and low frequency regions. The number of glycine immunoreactive puncta on the somata of principal cells showed significant decreases in all regions assessed, with changes ranging from 50\% in the VNTB to 23\% in the LSO.",0021-9967,NA,10.1002/cne.20795

(Loranthaceae), is used in the treatment of several diseases including immune-modifying diseases and thus there is a need to identify the immunoactive constituents., OBJECTIVE: This research isolated and characterized the immunoactive constituents in the Eastern Nigeria mistletoe., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bioassay-guided fractionation was employed in the isolation and purification of the constituents. The characterized compounds were screened for immunostimulatory activities on isolated C57BL/6 mice splenocytes and early activation marker, CD69 at concentrations of 10, 25, and 100 mug/mL using flow cytometry techniques and compared to lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 10 mug/mL) and concanavalin A (ConA; 2 mug/mL) as standards., RESULTS: Two compounds, a novel sesquiterpene, 2, 3-dimethoxy-benzo [a, b] cyclopentenyl-3',3',5'-trimethyl pyran-4-carboxylic acid, and a known alkaloid, lupinine were isolated and characterized. The compounds (25 mug/mL) showed statistically significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) stimulatory activity on the splenocytes with values of 56.34 +/- 0.26\% and 69.84 +/- 0.19\%, respectively, compared to 7.58 +/- 0.42\% recorded for the unstimulated control.

Savanna chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes vents) living in the Mandingue plateau of Senegal and Mali use caves for thermoregulation, where these refugia provide a cool microclimate during the hot, dry season. In this study, we examined cave use frequency for a chimpanzee community in southeastern Senegal. We used images from a camera trap placed at the mouth of a large laterite cave to investigate the hypotheses that sex, reproductive state, and seasonality influence the frequency of cave use. The camera collected 14,053 still images of chimpanzees between 2011 and 2013 over 325 camera trap days. Our results indicate no difference in cave use frequency between males and females overall. However, female reproductive state did significantly influence cave use, with lactating mothers using the cave more frequently than both males and nonlactating females. Chimpanzees used the cave during the hottest times of the day and were more likely to visit the cave during periods of low water availability and high maximum temperatures associated with the dry season. These results suggest the importance of thermoregulation in extreme heat for all individuals, and specifically for lactating females with nursing infants that likely experience higher metabolic and hydration stress.

dobigny_update_2008,Journal of Zoology (London),"An update on the taxonomy and geographic distribution of the cryptic species {Mastomys} kollmannspergeri ({Muridae}, {Murinae}) using combined cytogenetic and molecular data.","Multi-mammate rats (Muridae, Murinae, Mastomys spp.) are Sub-Saharan pest rodents, the systematics of which has long remained confused due to poor morphologic differentiation. Cytotaxonomy and DNA sequencing have provided excellent diagnostic markers for species identification, thus improving the assessment of taxonomic diversity within the genus. In West and Central Africa, three species have been unambiguously identified and are now well documented: Mastomys erythroleucus, Mastomys natalensis and Mastomys huberti. However, recent studies suggest the existence of two other taxa on the basis of morphology, DNA sequencing (Mastomys verheyeni, from Nigeria and Northern Cameroon) or karyotypes (Mastomys cf. kollmannspergeri, from Northern Niger and Chad). In order to clarify the systematic status of the latter taxa, we collected all the available cytotaxonomic as well as cytochrome b sequencing data to which were added results obtained from recently trapped specimens in Northern Cameroon. Our combined molecular and cytogenetic analyses unambiguously confirm the presence of another Mastomys species inhabiting various habitats in Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Sudan. This taxon is clearly differentiated from M. erythroleucus, M. huberti and M. natalensis. Furthermore, the inclusion in our analysis of two M. verheyeni paratypes as well as individuals trapped in close vicinity to the type locality of M. kollmannspergeri supports the assignation of all specimens to M. kollmanspergeri, thus making M. verheyeni its junior synonym. Our study once again highlights the reliability of DNA- and karyotype-based methods to accurately assess specific diversity in African rodents, particularly in the Mastomys genus, which shelters several species of agricultural and epidemiological importance.",0952-8369,NA,10.1111/j.1469-7998.2008.00500.x
ladele_sensory_1996,International journal of food sciences and nutrition,"Sensory quality ratings, consumption pattern and preference for some selected meat types in {Nigeria}.","Sensory quality attributes, consumption pattern and preference for some selected Nigerian meat types (beef, goat meat, mutton, grasscutter (Thryonomys swinderianus raptorum), African giant rat (Cricetomys gambianus--water house) were investigated. Sensory quality scores were carried out using a panel of thirty carefully screened consumers, based on a 9-point hedonic scale: While consumer consumption pattern and preference were assessed through a field survey of 120 randomly selected respondents using a well structured questionnaire. It was found that beef was the most consumed meat followed by goat meat, then mutton, grasscutter and lastly African giant rat. Consumption of grasscutter was constrained by availability and cost. Goat meat was the most preferred, followed by beef, grasscutter, mutton and African giant rat. In laboratory sensory rating of the meat types, grasscutter had the greatest acceptability followed by goat meat, mutton, African giant rat and lastly beef. The result showed that grasscutter was the most acceptable because of its good meat colour, flavour tenderness and juiciness. It is recommended that more research effort be placed on domestication, breeding and management of grasscutter and African giant rat so as to remove the availability and high cost constraints militating against the utilization of these mammals.",0963-7486,NA,NA

Our study focused on the plague-endemic West Nile region of Uganda, where a majority of residents live in Uganda government-defined poverty, rely on subsistence farming for a living, and frequently experience incursions of rodents into their homes. In this study, we show that rodent removal was achieved in a median of 6 days of intensive lethal trapping with multiple trap types (range: 0-16 days). However, rodent abundance in 68.9\% of homesteads returned to pretreatment levels within a median of 8 weeks (range 1-24 weeks), and at least a single rodent was captured in all homesteads by a median of 2 weeks (range 1-16 weeks) after removal efforts were terminated. Results were similar between homesteads that practiced rodent control whether or not their neighbors implemented similar strategies. Overall, intensive lethal trapping inside homes appears to be effective at reducing rodent abundance, but control was short lived after trapping ceased.",1530-3667,NA,10.1089/vbz.2018.2276
pereira_alterations_1998,Parasitology,Alterations in cytochrome-c oxidase expression between praziquantel-resistant and susceptible strains of {Schistosoma} mansoni.,"The genetic differences between praziquantel-resistant (R) and susceptible (S) strains of Schistosoma mansoni (Fallon \& Doenhoff, 1994) were explored using RAPD and by cloning differentially expressed mRNAs by subtractive PCR. No differences between the 2 strains were detectable by RAPD using 41 different primers indicating that no major genomic rearrangements were present. Subtractive PCR generated a number of fragments, 1 of which was shown to correspond to an over-expressed mRNA in the R strain and to encode a fragment of the subunit 1 of cytochrome-c oxidase (SCOX1). In the absence of a complete sequence for this gene, we used EST sequences to compile a consensus sequence for the 904 bp at the 3' end that enabled us to choose primers for semi-quantitative RT-PCR. This technique showed that SCOX1 was indeed over-expressed about 5 to 10-fold in the R strain whereas the genes encoding the 28 kDa glutathione S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 and the ATP-binding cassette family protein SMDR2 were not. In contrast, cytochrome-c oxidase enzyme activity was 4-fold lower in the R strain than in the S strain.",0031-1820,NA,NA

gillespie_inhibitory_2005,NATURE NEUROSCIENCE,Inhibitory synapses in the developing auditory system are glutamatergic,"Activity-dependent synapse refinement is crucial for the formation of precise excitatory and inhibitory neuronal circuits. Whereas the mechanisms that guide refinement of excitatory circuits are becoming increasingly clear, the mechanisms guiding inhibitory circuits have remained obscure. In the lateral superior olive (LSO), a nucleus in the mammalian sound localization system that receives inhibitory input from the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB), specific elimination and strengthening of synapses that are both GABAergic and glycinergic (GABA/glycinergic synapses) is essential for the formation of a precise tonotopic map. We provide evidence that immature GABA/glycinergic synapses in the rat LSO also release the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, which activates postsynaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs). Immunohistochemical studies demonstrate synaptic colocalization of the vesicular glutamate transporter 3 with the vesicular GABA transporter, indicating that GABA, glycine and glutamate are released from single MNTB terminals. Glutamatergic transmission at MNTB-LSO synapses is most prominent during the period of synapse elimination. Synapse-specific activation of NMDARs by glutamate release at GABAergic and glycinergic synapses could be important in activity-dependent refinement of inhibitory circuits.",1097-6256,NA,10.1038/nn1397

These strains had not been passed in suckling mice and were isolated in Aedes pseudoscutellaris Mos 61 cultured cells. These strains showed no virulence in three-week-old Swiss mice when injected intraperitoneally. Direct comparison of the large T1 RNase-resistant oligonucleotide maps indicated a relative genetic stability (92\%-100\%). A greater change was observed when these strains were compared with an epidemic YF strain isolated in 1965 with an oligonucleotide fingerprint map sharing 82\%-88\% similarity. The YF-specified proteins were identical in their molecular weight, and the fragments obtained after limited proteolysis of the envelope protein using protease V8 or alphachymotrypsine indicated that the strains were chemically similar. Only a few differences were observed when the strains were seroneutralized with MAF's, but no relation could be made with genetic or biological data. This suggested that the YF virus strains isolated from the same geographic area and during a short period of time had evolved slowly. Moreover, all the viruses were closely related and no correlation could be established with the apparent variations in virulence in nature.",0002-9637,NA,NA

In order to clarify the mechanisms by which NAS-501 exhibits the anti-ulcer effects, we investigated the anti-oxidative effects of NAS-501 in vitro and in vivo. NAS-501 significantly reduced the superoxide radical-dependent chemiluminescence, generated by hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase, rat neutrophils and guinea-pig macrophages in vitro. These in vitro effects were also confirmed by electron spin resonance using a 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide spin-trapping method. In addition, NAS-501 significantly inhibited lipid peroxidation induced by increasing concentrations of Fe2+/ascorbate in rat gastric mucosal homogenate in vitro. Oral administration of NAS-501 (30 mg/kg) significantly inhibited production of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance in rat gastric mucosa following per os instillation of 60\% ethanol in 150 mmol/l HCl in vivo. These results suggest that NAS-501 exhibits the preventive effect from acute gastric mucosal lesions by the anti-oxidative activity.",0031-7012,NA,10.1159/000028283
wagner_opioid-mediated_2001,JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS,Opioid-mediated facilitation of long-term depression in rat hippocampus,"Previous studies have demonstrated that opioid substances are often inhibitors of the gamma -aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmitter system in the hippocampal formation, and that GABA-mediated inhibition is a potent modulator of synaptic plasticity. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were recorded from the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices in response to stimulation of the Schaffer collateral fibers to monitor the effects of acute opioid exposure on the induction of long-term depression (LTD) at excitatory synapses in the stratum radiatum. Exogenous application of a selective mu -opioid agonist resulted in a greater than 2-fold enhancement of LTD, whereas kappa- and delta -agonists did not significantly affect LTD magnitude. Costimulation of the opioid peptide-containing stratum lacunosum-moleculare during LTD induction also resulted in a facilitation of LTD in the stratum radiatum, an effect prevented by prior administration of an opioid antagonist. These results suggest that both exogenously applied and endogenously released opioids can act to facilitate LTD of the Schaffer collateral input to CA1 pyramidal neurons.",0022-3565,NA,NA
temma_ca2_1997,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY,Ca2+ overloading causes the negative inotropic effect of doxorubicin in myocytes isolated from guinea-pig hearts,"We reported previously that conditions shown to increase Ca2+ loading augment the negative inotropic effect of doxorubicin. To examine if the negative inotropic effect is caused by Ca2+ overloading, doxorubicin-induced changes in diastolic and systolic Ca2+ concentrations and twitch contractions were studied under altered Ca2+ loading. Intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+](i)) were monitored in fura-2-loaded myocytes isolated from the ventricular muscle of guinea-pig hearts, Twitch contractions were estimated from the shortening of myocytes. In myocytes incubated at 34 degrees C in a medium containing 1.2 mM CaCl2 (standard conditions), doxorubicin (100 mu M) caused a significant decrease in diastolic length, and an increase in the amplitude of contraction. The positive inotropic effect of doxorubicin was followed by a negative effect. Concomitant with these changes in myocyte contractions, a monophasic increase in diastolic Ca2+, and an increase and a subsequent decrease in the amplitude of Ca2+ transients (peak [Ca2+](i) minus diastolic [Ca2+](i)) were observed. When the Ca2+ load of myocytes was increased by an incubation at a low temperature (25 degrees C) or in the presence of high Ca2+ in the incubation medium (2.4 mM CaCl2), diastolic [Ca2+](i) was elevated. Doxorubicin further increased diastolic [Ca2+](i). Under these conditions, the doxorubicin-induced increase in the twitch contraction lasted a shorter period of time and the subsequent decrease in contraction was significantly enhanced. The peak [Ca2+](i) initially increased slightly and then decreased. Thus, the decrease in the amplitude of Ca2+ transients, as well as myocyte contraction, was greater compared to the corresponding values observed under the standard conditions. These changes in the contraction and Ca2+ transient developed with the same time course, The effects of the low-temperature incubation were antagonized by verapamil. These results indicate that the negative inotropic effect of doxorubicin results from a decrease in the amplitude of Ca2+ transients caused by an increased diastolic [Ca2+](i) and a decreased peak [Ca2+](i). These changes are likely to be caused by myocardial Ca2+ overload. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.",0014-2999,NA,10.1016/S0014-2999(96)00994-6

Our aims were to determine whether these leiomyomas can become estradiol independent after exposure to estradiol and ii raloxifene inhibits leiomyoma growth when given concomitantly with estradiol. STUDY DESIGN: To induce leiomyoma development, 6 oophorectomized animals received two estradiol implants for 140 days. Next, the estradiol implants were replaced with empty implants in 3 animals, whereas the other 3 received 2 new estradiol implants and raloxifene given per os 10 mg/kg per day for 60 days. Tumor size was monitored biweekly by ultrasonography. RESULTS: On estradiol removal, abdominal wall leiomyomas regressed within 15 to 30 days; when estradiol implants were reintroduced, leiomyomas redeveloped. Within 30 days on raloxifene, all abdominal leiomyomas (n = 9) regressed as determined by ultrasonography and verified at laparotomy. Serum raloxifene and estradiol levels were 432 +/- 46 pg/mL and 78 +/- 13 pg/mL (mean +/- SEM, n = 3), respectively, after 60 days of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Leiomyomas did not become estradiol independent, even after long exposure to estradiol; ultrasonography allowed frequent, noninvasive assessment of leiomyoma site, and raloxifene rapidly regressed leiomyomas in this animal model.",0002-9378,NA,10.1016/S0002-9378(98)70148-6
tarandovskiy_interspecies_2020,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Interspecies comparison of simultaneous thrombin and plasmin generation,"Animal models of hemostasis are often extrapolated to humans; however, only a few studies have compared coagulation and fibrinolysis across species. Simultaneous thrombin (TG) and plasmin (PG) generation is useful to assessing coagulation and fibrinolysis within the same sample. In this study, we performed simultaneous TG and PG analysis in blood plasma samples from humans and 6 species commonly evaluated in pre-clinical research. TG and PG were investigated in male and female donor platelet-poor plasmas (PPP) obtained from 28 healthy humans, 10 baboons, 12 rhesus monkeys, 20 Yorkshire pigs, 20 Sprague-Dawley rats, 10 New Zealand White rabbits and 14 Hartley guinea pigs. The continuous generation of the 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) from substrates specific to thrombin or plasmin was monitored. The thrombin and plasmin concentration peak heights (PH) and production rates (PR) were calculated. TG and PG parameters from baboon and rhesus macaque plasma approximated that of humans. The other species differed significantly from both human and non-human primates. For example, swine and rat plasmas demonstrated similar TG, but swine plasmas did not generate plasmin. TG and PG parameters from Guinea pig samples were extremely low, while rabbit plasmas showed variable PG curves demonstrating one or two peaks with low and high PR values, respectively. Correlations between PH and PR values were significant with the exceptions of human PG, baboon TG, rat TG and Guinea pig PG. These findings are informative to pre-clinical animal species selection and optimization of coagulation and fibrinolysis translational research.",2045-2322,NA,10.1038/s41598-020-60436-1

Methods The immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) was used for IgG and IgM anti-Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies in tilter paper bloodspot eluates from 128 subjects (73 females, 55 males) selected by systematic sampling. Concerning each subject age, gender, birthplace, occupation, duration of residence and building materials used in their houses were recorded. Vectors were captured both in domestic and peridomestic environments. Results Seropositive, 12.5\% (16/128): females, 15.1\% (11/73); males, 9.1\% (5/55). Average time of residence: 6.1 years for the whole population sample and 7.4 years for the seropositive subjects. Most houses had adobe walls (76.7\%, n = 30), galvanized iron rooves (86.7\%) and earthen floors (53.4\%) 80\% of the walls had crevices. One hundred forty seven specimens of Triatoma infestans were captured, of which 104 (70.7\%) were domestic, and I peridomestic Triatoma sordida. Precipitin host identification: birds, 67.5\%; humans, 27.8\%; rodents, 11.9\%; dogs, 8.7\%; cats, 1.6\%. House infestation and density indices were 53.3 and 493.0 respectively. We found 21 (14.3\%) specimens of T: infestans infected with trypanosomes, 18 (85.7\%) of which in domestic environments. Discussion The elements for the vector transmission of Chagas disease are present in Avaroa/Primer de Mayo and the ancient custom of keeping guinea pigs indoors adds to the risk of human infection. In neighboring Cochabamba, due to sub-standard quality control, contaminated blood transfusions are not infrequent, which further aggravates the spread of Chagas disease. Prompt action to check the transmission of this infection, involving additionally the congenital and transfusional modes of acquisition, is required.",0034-8910,NA,10.1590/S0034-89101999000300003
kamani_coxiella_2018-1,Ticks and tick-borne diseases,Coxiella burnetii and {Rickettsia} conorii: {Two} zoonotic pathogens in peridomestic rodents and their ectoparasites in {Nigeria}.,"Rodents are hosts of numerous pathogenic agents of public health importance globally. Their ability to harbor these pathogens without showing overt clinical signs of disease has epidemiologic consequences. In some rural settings in Nigeria, humans and rodents do not only share feeds and abode, but the latter may end up on the table of the former as a source of protein, thereby increasing the risks of disease transmission. Molecular assays were used to detect and characterize two agents of zoonotic importance, Coxiella burnetii and Rickettsia spp. in 194 peridomestic rodents captured in a peri-urban setting in Nigeria, and 32 pools of ectoparasites removed from them, to determine their possible role in the epidemiology of these diseases in this country. Targeting and characterizing the insertion sequence IS1111, C. burnetii DNA was detected in 4 out of 194 (2.1\%) rodents comprising 3 out of 121 (2.5\%) Rattus norvegicus and 1 out of 48 (2.1\%) Rattus rattus screened in this study. Rickettsia spp. DNA was detected in two Rhipicephalus sanginueus sensu lato pools (i.e. RT1 and RT4) using the citrate synthase (gltA) gene and further characterized by amplification and sequence analysis of six genes to determine their identity. The RT1 sample consistently gave 98-100\% identity to Rickettsia conorii str. Malish 7 for the various genes and loci studied. However, the identity of RT4 could not be definitively determined due to variable identities to different Rickettsia spp. according to the gene or loci under consideration. Further isolation study to determine if the RT4 characterized is a new variant or a mixture of sequences of different rickettsiae within the pool will be worthwhile. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

Despite intense experimental research in this field, the earlier cellular events that initiate and sustain a focal seizure are still not well defined. Their identification is central to understand the pathophysiology of focal epilepsies and to develop new pharmacological therapies for drug-resistant forms of epilepsy. The prominent involvement of astrocytes in ictogenesis was recently proposed. We test here whether a cooperation between astrocytes and neurons is a prerequisite to support ictal (seizure-like) and interictal epileptiform events. Simultaneous patch-clamp recording and Ca(2+) imaging techniques were performed in a new in vitro model of focal seizures induced by local applications of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid ( NMDA) in rat entorhinal cortex slices. We found that a Ca(2+) elevation in astrocytes correlates with both the initial development and the maintenance of a focal, seizure-like discharge. A delayed astrocyte activation during ictal discharges was also observed in other models ( including the whole in vitro isolated guinea pig brain) in which the site of generation of seizure activity cannot be precisely monitored. In contrast, interictal discharges were not associated with Ca(2+) changes in astrocytes. Selective inhibition or stimulation of astrocyte Ca(2+) signalling blocked or enhanced, respectively, ictal discharges, but did not affect interictal discharge generation. Our data reveal that neurons engage astrocytes in a recurrent excitatory loop ( possibly involving gliotransmission) that promotes seizure ignition and sustains the ictal discharge. This neuron-astrocyte interaction may represent a novel target to develop effective therapeutic strategies to control seizures.",1544-9173,NA,10.1371/journal.pbio.1000352

Identification and reduction of exposure to such compounds is an important public health goal. We examined the effect of cashew shell oil (CSO), used in skin tattooing for its potential to induce skin transformation in rats. Corn oil and CSO (25, 50, and 100\%) were topically applied to depilated sections of Wistar' rat skin (groups: I-IV) for six weeks. Effect of treatments on serum transaminases activity, histological changes in hepatocytes and induction of micronuclei in the bone marrow were examined. In addition, CSO-induced hepatocyte proliferation was also quantified. All animals survived the course of the study. Reduced percentage change in body weight and physical trauma were observed in CSO-treated rat. The effects were more prominent in Group IV (100\% CSO). Relative liver weights and number of hepatocytes (cells/mm(2)) increased significantly in groups II-IV relative to control (p {\textless} 0.05). Serum transaminases activities were not significantly (p {\textgreater} 0.05) affected in treated groups.

lomax_sympathetic_2007,JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON,Sympathetic vasoconstrictor regulation of mouse colonic submucosal arterioles is altered in experimental colitis,"Recent studies suggest that altered neural regulation of the gastrointestinal microvasculature contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore, we employed video microscopy techniques to monitor nerve-evoked vasoconstrictor responses in mouse colonic submucosal arterioles in vitro and examined the effect of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) colitis. Nerve stimulation (2-20 Hz) caused frequency-dependent vasoconstrictor responses that were abolished by tetrodotoxin (300 nM) and guanethidine (10 mu M). The P2 receptor antagonist suramin (100 mu M) or the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (100 nM) reduced the vasoconstriction and the combination of suramin and prazosin completely abolished responses. Nerve-evoked constrictions of submucosal arterioles from mice with TNBS colitis were inhibited by prazosin but not suramin. Superfusion of ATP (10 mu M) resulted in large vasoconstrictions in control mice but had no effect in mice with colitis whereas constrictions to phenylephrine (3 mu M) were unaffected. P2X(1) receptor immunohistochemistry did not suggest any alteration in receptor expression following colitis. However, Western blotting revealed that submucosal P2X1 receptor expression was increased during colitis. In contrast to ATP, alpha beta-methylene-ATP (1 mu M), which is resistant to catabolism by nucleotidases, constricted control and TNBS arterioles. This indicates that reduced purinergic transmission to submucosal arterioles may be due to increased degradation of ATP during colitis. These data comprise the first description of the neural regulation of mouse submucosal arterioles and identify a defect in sympathetic regulation of the GI vasculature during colitis due to reduced purinergic neurotransmission.",0022-3751,NA,10.1113/jphysiol.2007.136838

We describe the isolation and characterization of the first bioactive peptide from the venom of this species. This 30AA venom peptide is named conotoxin AtVIA (delta-conotoxin-like). An excitatory activity was manifested by the peptide on a majority of mouse lumbar dorsal root ganglion neurons. An analog of AtVIA with conservative changes on three amino acid residues at the C-terminal region was synthesized and this analog produced an identical effect on the mouse neurons. AtVIA has homology with delta-conotoxins from other worm-hunters, which include conserved sequence elements that are shared with delta-conotoxins from fish-hunting Conus. In contrast, there is no comparable sequence similarity with delta-conotoxins from the venoms of molluscivorous Conus species.

These effects need to be well characterized to allow a reliable quantification of the effects of the experimental agent being tested. Objectives: The study focused on the accurate description of the electrophysiological effects on the cochlear potential recordings of perilymphatic perfusions. Methods: Two successive cochlear perilymphatic perfusions were carried out. The first used artificial perilymph. The second used artificial perilymph alone or a kainic acid (KA) solution in artificial perilymph. The compound action potential of the auditory nerve (CAP-AN) was recorded: (1) before the first perfusion, (2) after the first perfusion and (3) after the second perfusion, and compared between groups. Results: The first intracochlear perfusion with artificial perilymph produced significant effects in the CAP-AN that could be related to the surgical procedure. These effects were analysed separately from the effects produced by the KA. In particular, the KA administered intracochlearly produced a significant increase in the latency and a decrease in the amplitude of the CAP-AN N1 wave compared with the controls that were perfused twice with artificial perilymph.",0001-6489,NA,10.3109/00016489.2012.678945
adedara_nigerian_2014,Drug and chemical toxicology,Nigerian bonny light crude oil induces endocrine disruption in male rats.,"Exposure to Nigerian bonny light crude oil (BLCO) in the southern part of Nigeria has been reported to be associated with reproductive toxicity, but there is paucity of information on its interference with steroidogenesis. This study investigated the influence of BLCO on testicular steroidogenesis and plasma levels of hormones from the pituitary and thyroid components of the brain-pituitary-testicular axis. Adult male Wistar rats were orally treated with BLCO dissolved in corn oil at 0, 200 and 800 mg/kg for 7 days. Immunoblot analysis revealed that BLCO exposure suppressed steroid acute regulatory protein and androgen-binding protein expression with concomitant decrease in 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) and 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities. BLCO exposure significantly decreased plasma concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin and intratesticular testosterone, but elevated thyrotropin, triiodothyronine and thyroxine above the control values. The data presented herein indicate that undue exposure to BLCO has an inhibitory effect on testicular steroidogenesis. The underlying mechanisms for BLCO-induced testicular dysfunction may involve its disruptive effect on the brain-pituitary-testicular axis. These observations highlight the potential risk to public health for a population where, unfortunately, oil spillages occur frequently.",1525-6014,NA,10.3109/01480545.2013.834359
kanehiro_timing_2000,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE,Timing of administration of anti-{VLA}-4 differentiates airway hyperresponsiveness in the central and peripheral airways in mice,"The development of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) is correlated with the infiltration into the lungs of activated eosinophils and T lymphocytes. In large part, influx of eosinophils into the lung is dependent on very late activating antigen-4 (VLA-4) expression. However, the kinetics of eosinophil recruitment and the development of AHR are not fully delineated. Airway function was monitored by changes in lung resistance (RL) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn) to methacholine (MCh) inhalation after anti-VLA-4. After ovalbumin (OVA) sensitization and airway challenge of BALB/c mice, AHR increased as did the number of lung inflammatory cells. Administration of anti-VLA-4 to sensitized mice 2 h before the first (of three) OVA airway challenges significantly prevented changes in RL. Moreover, injection of the antibody from 2 h before the first challenge to 42 h after the last challenge significantly prevented the increases in RL, as well as eosinophil and lymphocyte numbers in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF); interleukin-5 (IL-5) and leukotriene concentrations in BALF were also significantly inhibited. Interestingly, treatment with anti-VLA-4 only prevented changes in Cdyn and goblet cell hyperplasia when administered 2 h before the first challenge. These studies demonstrate that the timing of anti-VLA-4 administration can selectively affect pathologic processes that contribute to altered airway function in the central and peripheral airways after allergen challenge.",1073-449X,NA,10.1164/ajrccm.162.3.9910100

Most notably, this virus causes infectious mononucleosis but it is also associated with cancers such as Hodgkin and Burkitt lymphoma. EBV is a species-specific virus and has been studied in many animal models, including nonhuman primates, guinea pigs, humanized mice, and tree shrews. However, none of these animal models are considered the â€œgold standardâ€  for EBV research. Recently, rabbits have emerged as a viable alternative model, as they are susceptible to EBV infection. In addition, the EBV infection progresses after immune suppression with cyclosporine A (CsA), modeling the reactivation of EBV after latency. We sought to refine this model for acute or active EBV infections by performing antibody-mediated depletion of certain immune subsets in rabbits. Fourteen 16 to 20-wk old, NZW rabbits were intravenously inoculated with EBV and concurrently treated with either anti-CD4 T-cell antibody, anti-pan-T-cell antibody (anti CD45), CSA, or, as a control, anti-HPV antibody. Rabbits that received the depleting antibodies were treated with CsA 3 times at a dose of 15 mg/kg SC once per day for 4 d starting at the time of EBV inoculation then the dose was increased to 20 mg/kg SC twice weekly for 2 wk. Weights, temperatures, and clinical signs were monitored, and rabbits were anesthetized once weekly for blood collection. When compared with the control group, anti-CD4-treated rabbits had fewer clinical signs and displayed higher levels of viral DNA via qPCR in splenocytes; however, flow cytometry results showed only a partial depletion of CD4 T-cells. Treatment with anti-pan-T-cell antibody did not result in noticeable T-cell depletion. These data suggest the EBV-infected rabbit is a promising model for testing antiviral medications and prophylactic vaccines for EBV.",1532-0820,NA,10.30802/AALAS-CM-20-000019

galal_introduction_2019,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,The introduction of new hosts with human trade shapes the extant distribution of {Toxoplasma} gondii lineages.,"Toxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic protozoan with a worldwide occurrence, but the determinants of the current pattern in the geographical distribution of T. gondii lineages and strains remain poorly understood. To test the influence of human trade on T. gondii populations, we conducted a population genetic study of 72 T. gondii animal isolates from Senegal, a West African country in which the ongoing inland progress of invasive murine hosts (introduced in port cities of Senegal since the 16th century by European sailors) is well described. Isolates were mainly collected on free-range poultry, which are considered as relevant bioindicators of T. gondii strain diversity in the domestic environment. Sampling was conducted in two port cities of Senegal (Dakar and Saint-Louis) and in one inland region (Kedougou). Population genetic analyses using 15 microsatellite markers revealed different patterns between port cities where lineages non-virulent for mice (type II, type III, and Africa 4) were predominant, and Kedougou where the mouse-virulent Africa 1 lineage was the most common. By considering the current spatial pattern in the inland progress of invasive rodents in Senegal, our results suggest that the invasive house mouse Mus musculus domesticus counter-selects the Africa 1 lineage in the invaded areas. The comparison of the microsatellite alleles of type II strains from Senegal to type II strains from other areas in Africa and Western Europe, using discriminant analysis of principal components and Network analysis, point to a mainly Western European origin of the type II lineage in Senegal. Collectively, these findings suggest that human-mediated intercontinental migrations of murine hosts are important vectors of T. gondii strains. Differential susceptibility of endemic and introduced murine hosts to various T. gondii strains probably determines the persistence of these strains in the environment, and therefore their availability for human and animal infection.",1935-2735,NA,10.1371/journal.pntd.0007435

To investigate the long-term influence of perivascular innervation on the vascular endothelium, the release of vasoactive substances which have been localised in endothelial cells, namely ATP, endothelin, substance P and vasopressin, was monitored from cells isolated from adult rat thoracic aorta following neonatal guanethidine sympathectomy. The endothelial cells were initially perfused at 0.5 ml/min and exposed to two periods of increased flow at 3.0 ml/min. Cells isolated from control rats released significantly more ATP on both occasions of switching from the lower to higher flow rate and significantly more endothelin on the second exposure to the higher flow rate. In contrast, endothelial cells isolated from sympathectomised rats showed no increased release of either ATP or endothelin with increased flow, although the release of endothelin at the initial flow rate of 0.5 ml/min was higher than in the controls. Substance P and vasopressin levels in the perfusate were the same in controls and after sympathectomy. In summary, long-term sympathectomy suppresses increased flow-induced release of selected vasoactive substances from the endothelium, thus shear-stress-induced changes in local blood flow may be impaired when there are chronic disturbances in the autonomic innervation.",1018-1172,NA,10.1159/000159142

They were classified into three groups according to their functional properties. U-1 units (30\% of the units) responded to contractions of the ureter and exhibited very low spontaneous activity (mean: 0.1 Hz). They had low average thresholds to distension (5.8 mmHg or 0.77 kPa), responded immediately to mechanical stimuli without exhibiting after discharges to strong stimuli. Their function might be the monitoring of peristalsis. U-2 units (38\%) did not respond to contractions and had irregular spontaneous activities (mean: 0.7 Hz). They exhibited a high average activation threshold to distension (42.6 mmHg or 5.73 kPa) and after discharges to strong mechanical stimuli. U-2 units might be involved in nociception. U-G units (32\%) were characterized by their long-latency response to any mechanical stimulus used and had a regular high ongoing activity (mean: 2.2 Hz). The pressure thresholds cover the whole range of the U-1 and U-2 units (5 to 70 mmHg or 0.67-9.33 kPa) with an average of 31.5 mmHg or 4.2 kPa. The peak discharge to pressure stimuli occurred much later than in the U-1 and U-2 units and they exhibited pronounced after discharges. Some U-G units were inhibited by mechanical stimuli. U-G units had large receptive fields sometimes covering the entire ureter. The units responded to electrical stimulation of the ureter after a variable latency, indicating that they were synaptically driven. In addition, a late long-lasting response to electrical stimulation was observed. These data suggest that low- and high-threshold primary afferent fibres (U-1 and U-2 units) modulate the activity of ureteric ganglion cells (U-G units).",0031-6768,NA,10.1007/BF00374186
mule_evidence_2007,PHARMACOLOGICAL RESEARCH,Evidence for a modulatory role of cannabinoids on the excitatory {NANC} neurotransmission in mouse colon,"It is well accepted that endogenous cannabinoids and CB I receptors are involved in the regulation of smooth muscle contractility and intestinal motility, through a mechanism mainly related to reduction of acetylcholine release from cholinergic nerve endings. Because, few data exist on a possible modulatory action of the cannabinoid agents on the non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of cannabinoid drugs on the NANC responses elicited by electrical field stimulation (EFS) in the circular muscle of mouse proximal colon. Colonic contractions were monitored as changes in endoluminal pressure. In NANC conditions, EFS evoked TTX-sensitive responses, characterized by a relaxation, nitrergic in origin, followed by a contraction. The EFS-evoked contraction was significantly reduced by SR48968, NK2 receptor antagonist, and abolished by co-administration of SR48968 and SR140333, NK1 receptor antagonist, suggesting that it was due to release of tachykinins. The cannabinoid receptor synthetic agonist, WIN55,212- 2, the putative endogenous ligand, anandamide, the selective CB I receptor agonist ACEA, but not the selective CB2 receptor agonist JWH-015, produced a concentration-dependent reduction of the NANC contractile responses, without affecting the NANC relaxation. ACEA or anandamide did not modify the contractions induced by exogenous [beta-Ala(8)]-NKA(4-10), agonist of NK2 receptors. The selective antagonist of CB1 receptors, SR141716A, per se failed to affect the EFS-evoked responses, but antagonized the inhibitory effects of WIN55,212-2, anandamide and ACEA on NANC contractile responses. AM630, CB2 receptor antagonist, did not modify the inhibitory effects of WIN55,212-2 or anandamide. URB597, inhibitor of the fatty acid amide hydrolase, enzyme which catalyze the hydrolysis of anandamide, was without any effect on the NANC evoked responses. We conclude that the activation of prejunctional CB I receptors produces inhibition of NANC contractile responses in mouse colonic preparations. However, endogenous ligands do not seem to modulate tonically the NANC transmission in mouse colon. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1043-6618,NA,10.1016/j.phrs.2007.04.019

On the guinea-pig ileum, the extract was shown to be a partial agonist acting via muscarinic receptors. Acetylcholine (ACh) was 2.5 x 10(5) times more potent. On the pregnant guinea-pig uterus, the extract induced concentration-dependent increases in the force of contraction and tonus. Oxytocin and ergometrine were respectively 10(6) and 10(3) times more potent. The extract, at subliminal concentrations, potentiated ACh and adrenaline-induced contractions in the guinea-pig was deferens. It also induced dose-related vasodilatation in the rat hindquarters and depressed the blood pressure in the anaesthetized cat. It was concluded that these pharmacological actions offer some scientific explanation for the use of Diodia scandens in traditional medicine as a laxative and as an oxytocic agent. It is suggested that the extract could enhance erection and ejaculatory processes in the male, thus accounting for its regular use by some elderly males.

Recent surveys (captures and bat detectors) of small mammals from the upper Okavango catchment yielded 46 species (33 species of bats, ten species of rodents and three species of shrews). One bat (Pipistrellus rusticus, rusty pipistrelle); two rodents (Mus setzeri, Setzer's mouse and Zelotomys woosnami, Woosnam's broad-faced mouse) and one shrew (Suncus varilla, lesser dwarf shrew) were captured for the first time, in Angola. While our species lists of bats conformed to predicted totals, terrestrial small mammals were under sampled, with only 13 species recorded by our trapping survey compared to a total of 42 shrew and rodent species expected based on GBIF records for the central Angolan highlands. Seven terrestrial small mammal species (one shrew and six rodents) are endemic to the central and western Angolan highlands but none of these were captured in our survey. The bat detector surveys added three further bat species to the country list: Pipistrellus hesperidus, Kerivoula argentata, and Mops midas. Camera trap surveys and opportunistic sightings in the upper Okavango catchment in 2016 yielded a total of 35 species of medium-large mammals, from 17 families, although all of these had been reported previously in Angola.

The aim of this study was to determine the molecular identity of the pore-forming alpha-subunit of the HJCSM Na (+) channel. Degenerate primers identified a cDNA fragment of 1.5 kb with 99\% nucleotide homology with human cardiac SCN5A. The identified clone was also amplified from single smooth muscle cells by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Northern blot analysis showed expression of full-length SCN5A. Laser capture microdissection was used to obtain highly purified populations of HJCSM cells. RT-PCR on the harvested cells showed that SCN5A was present in circular but not in longitudinal muscle. A similar result was obtained using a pan-Na (+) channel antibody. The full-length sequence for SCN5A was obtained by combining standard polymerase chain reaction with 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA end techniques. The intestinal SCN5A was nearly identical to the cardiac SCN5A.

To gain insight into the nature of the humoral response of PI from Liberia and Ecuador, their sera and those of infected individuals were investigated and compared using western blots. The antigen preparations used were extracts of third- and fourth-stage larvae (L3 and L4, respectively), excretory-secretory proteins (ES-L3) and extracts of third-stage larvae (L3-day2) that had been cultured for 2 days, and extracts of nodular and skin microfilariae. Whereas some antigens were commonly recognized by all individuals, many stage-specific antigens (of 68, 60, 55, 46, 43, 42, 20 and 18 kDa in L3; 100, 88, 80, 50, 48, 45, 40 and 20 kDa in L3-day2; 110, 80 and 72 kDa in ES-L3; 48, 18, 16 and 14 kDa in L4; and 115, 60, 47, 43 and 17 kDa in skin and/or nodular microfilariae) were uniquely recognized by sera from PI. Some of the unique antigens were also recognized by sera from mice and a chimpanzee that were resistant to challenge after immunization with irradiated third-stage larvae.

bao_partial_2005,JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE,"Partial mitochondrial inhibition causes striatal dopamine release suppression and medium spiny neuron depolarization via {H2O2} elevation, not {ATP} depletion","Mitochondrial dysfunction is a potential causal factor in Parkinson's disease. We show here that acute exposure to the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone (30-100 nM; 30 min) causes concentration-dependent suppression of single-pulse evoked dopamine (DA) release monitored in real time with carbon-fiber microelectrodes in guinea pig striatal slices, with no effect on DA content. Suppression of DA release was prevented by the sulfonylurea glibenclamide, implicating ATP-sensitive K+ (K-ATP) channels; however, tissue ATP was unaltered. Because K-ATP channels can be activated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as well as by low ATP, we examined the involvement of rotenone-enhanced H2O2 generation. Confirming an essential role for H2O2, the inhibition of DA release by rotenone was prevented by catalase, a peroxide-scavenging enzyme. Striatal H2O2 generation during rotenone exposure was examined in individual medium spiny neurons using fluorescence imaging with dichlorofluorescein (DCF). An increase in intracellular H2O2 levels followed a similar time course to that of DA release suppression and was accompanied by cell membrane depolarization, decreased input resistance, and increased excitability. Extracellular catalase markedly attenuated the increase in DCF fluorescence and prevented rotenone-induced effects on membrane properties; membrane changes were also largely prevented by flufenamic acid, a blocker of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. Thus, partial mitochondrial inhibition can cause functional DA denervation via H2O2 and K-ATP channels, without DA or ATP depletion. Furthermore, amplified H2O2 levels and TRP channel activation in striatal spiny neurons indicate potential sources of damage in these cells. Overall, these novel factors could contribute to parkinsonian motor deficits and neuronal degeneration caused by mitochondrial dysfunction.",0270-6474,NA,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2652-05.2005

To verify or refute the mechanism of permeation enhancement with thiolated polymers via GSH by the use of NaFlu as marker for the paracellular permeation. Methods. The capability of 0.5\% polycarbophil cysteine conjugate (PCP-Cys) to reduce 0.02\% oxidized glutathione (GSSG) was evaluated via iodometric titration in aqueous solution. Glutathione in its reduced form (GSH; 0.1\%-0.4\%) and in combination with 0.5\% PCP-Cys were tested for their permeation enhancement of sodium fluorescein (NaFlu) and fluorescence labeled bacitracin (bac-FITC) used as paracellular markers. Permeation studies across guinea pig duodenum were carried out in Ussing-type chambers. Opening of the tight junctions was additionally monitored by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements. Results. PCP-Cys (0.5\%) was shown to reduce 22.0\% +/- 8.2\% of GSSG (0.02\%) to GSH in aqueous solution at pH 7.0 and 37degreesC within 3 h. Permeation of NaFlu was shown to depend on the concentration of GSH. The apparent permeability coefficient (P(a)pp) of NaFlu in buffer only was 4.98 +/- 0.5*10(-)6, while in the presence of 0.4\% GSH a P(a)pp of 9.31 +/- 0.92*10(-)6 was achieved, representing an enhancement ratio (R = P(a)pp enhancer system/P(a)pp control) of 1.86. The combination of GSH (0.4\%) with PCP-Cys (0.5\%) led to a significant (p {\textless} 0.001) improvement of R for NaFlu up to 2.93 accompanied by a decrease in TEER of 20.3\% +/- 1.4\%. Incubation of bac-FITC with the same GSH / PCP-Cys combination led to an enhancement ratio of 2.06 within 3 h. Conclusion. GSH plays an important role in the opening of tight junctions of intestinal epithelia. It would appear that PCP-Cys is able to reduce GSSG, prolonging the concentration of GSH at the apical membrane, resulting in significantly enhanced paracellular transport.",0724-8741,NA,10.1023/A:1015345827091
tatard_rodent-borne_2017-2,ACTA TROPICA,Rodent-borne {Trypanosoma} from cities and villages of {Niger} and {Nigeria}: {A} special role for the invasive genus {Rattus}?,"Although they are known to sometimes infect humans, atypical trypanosomes are very poorly documented, especially in Africa where one lethal case has yet been described. Here we conducted a survey of rodent-borne Trypanosoma in 19 towns and villages of Niger and Nigeria, with a special emphasis on Niamey, the capital city of Niger. The 1298 rodents that were captured yielded 189 qPCR-positive animals from 14 localities, thus corresponding to a 14.6\% overall prevalence. Rats, especially black rats, displayed particularly elevated prevalence (27.4\%), with some well sampled sites showing 40-50\% and up to 68.8\% of Trypanosoma-carrying individuals. Rattus were also characterized by significantly lower Ct values than in the other non-Rattus species. DNA sequences could be obtained for 43 rodent-borne Trypanosoma and corresponded to 41 T. lewisi (all from Rattus) and 2 T. microti (from Cricetomys gambianus). These results, together with data compiled from the available literature, suggest that Rattus may play a particular role for the maintaining and circulation of Trypanosoma, especially T. lewisi, in Africa. Taken into account its strong abilities to invade coastal and inland regions of the continent, we believe that this genus deserves a particular attention in regards to potentially under-looked but emerging atypical trypanosome-related diseases.",0001-706X,NA,10.1016/j.actatropica.2017.03.027

Therefore, the present study sought to describe trematode infections in B. pfeifferi from the River Uzuru in the Nigeria Cement Factory area, Nkalagu, south-eastern Nigeria. Four hundred and sixty snails were checked for trematode infections, and mice were exposed to the Schistosoma cercariae shed from the snails. Adult worms were harvested from the mice 13 weeks post-infection, while sections of the liver and spleen were examined. Primary school children living in the area were screened for S. mansoni infection and assessed for activities involving water contact. The edges of the river were also searched for burrows and rodents. The five cercaria morphotypes found were armatae xiphidiocercariae, echinocercariae, Schistosoma cercariae, cystophorous cercariae and cercariaeum cercariae. The overall prevalence and mean intensity of trematode infections were 39.78\% and 195.46, with the prevalence and mean intensity of most cercaria morphotypes higher in the hot-dry than in the cool-dry season. The infected mice showed S. mansoni-like characteristics but the stool samples of the schoolchildren were negative for S. mansoni eggs. Water-contact activities in the River Uzuru were minimal. Burrows were seen at the river edges but no Schistosoma eggs were recovered from captured rats. This is the first report of Schistosoma cercariae and other cercaria morphotypes in B. pfeifferi from south-eastern Nigeria. Additional molecular investigations are needed to identify correctly these Schistosoma cercariae, due to their public health implication.",1475-2697,NA,10.1017/S0022149X16000353

This study investigated the ability of a spin trap, alpha-phenyl-tert-butyl-nitrone (PBN), to prevent acute aminoglycoside antibiotic drop-induced cochlear dysfunction. Guinea pigs were monitored for compound action potential thresholds and 1.0 mu V root-mean-square cochlear microphonic isopotential curve values, then injected intraperitoneally with PEN (60 mg/kg) or saline solution. After 10 minutes, 50 mu l of PEN (100 mmol/L) or artificial perilymph was applied to the round window membrane, followed after 10 minutes with artificial perilymph or aminoglycoside antibiotic drops (50 mu l). From 10 to 60 minutes after exposure, mean compound action potential thresholds progressively increased in the artificial perilymph-aminoglycoside antibiotic drop group, beginning with high frequencies and later including ever-lower frequencies. These threshold shifts in compound action potentials were significantly greater (p {\textless} 0.05) than those seen in the artificial perilymph-artificial perilymph or PBN-aminoglycoside antibiotic drop groups. This finding indicates that PEN provided protection against acute aminoglycoside antibiotic drop-induced compound action potential threshold sensitivity loss. Mean cochlear microphonic shift values at 60 minutes in the artificial perilymph-aminoglycoside antibiotic drop group significantly exceeded those of the other groups only at the highest frequencies. These data suggest that acute aminoglycoside antibiotic drop-induced cochlear disruption primarily affects high frequency compound action potential function and may be partially reactive oxygen species-mediated and preventable.",0194-5998,NA,10.1016/S0194-5998(98)70015-4

The role of supporting cells in the development of the organ of Corti is much less elucidated than that of the cochlear sensory receptor cells. The use of our recently published method of single-cell electroporation loading of a fluorescent Ca2+ probe in the mouse hemicochlea preparation provided an appropriate means to investigate the Deiters' cells at the subcellular level in two different cochlear turns (apical, middle). Deiters' cell's soma and process elongated, and the process became slimmer by maturation without tonotopic preference. The tonotopically heterogeneous spontaneous Ca2+ activity less frequently occurred by maturation and implied subcellular difference. The exogenous ATP- and UTP-evoked Ca2+ responses were maturation-dependent and showed P2Y receptor dominance in the apical turn. By monitoring the basic structural dimensions of this supporting cell type as well as its spontaneous and evoked purinergic Ca2+ signaling in the hemicochlea preparation in different stages in the critical postnatal P5-25 developmental period for the first time, we showed that the soma and the phalangeal process of the Deiters' cells go through age- and tonotopy-dependent changes in the morphometric parameters and purinergic signaling.",NA,NA,10.3390/cells8101266
capilla_animal_2007,MEDICAL MYCOLOGY,Animal models: an important tool in mycology,"Animal models of fungal infections are, and will remain, a key tool in the advancement of the medical mycology. Many different types of animal models of fungal infection have been developed, with murine models the most frequently used, for studies of pathogenesis, virulence, immunology, diagnosis, and therapy. The ability to control numerous variables in performing the model allows us to mimic human disease states and quantitatively monitor the course of the disease. However, no single model can answer all questions and different animal species or different routes of infection can show somewhat different results. Thus, the choice of which animal model to use Must be made carefully, addressing issues of the type of human disease to mimic, the parameters to follow and collection of the appropriate data to answer those questions being asked. This review addresses a variety of uses for animal models in medical mycology. It focuses on the most clinically important diseases affecting humans and cites various examples of the different types of studies that have been performed. Overall, animal models of fungal infection will continue to be valuable tools in addressing questions concerning fungal infections and contribute to our deeper understanding of how these infections occur, progress and can be controlled and eliminated.",1369-3786,NA,10.1080/13693780701644140
cowlishaw_evidence_2005,Journal of Applied Ecology,Evidence for post-depletion sustainability in a mature bushmeat market.,"1. The trade in wild animals for meat, or 'bushmeat', is perceived as one of the most important threats to wildlife in the tropics. Unsustainable bushmeat extraction also threatens the loss of livelihoods. However, the long-term persistence of the bushmeat trade, documented in Africa over several centuries, suggests that the trade can be sustainable. In this study, we investigate sustainability in a mature bushmeat market in West Africa (Takoradi, Ghana).2. Our study, conducted over January and February 2000, combined biological and socio-economic approaches. Offtake data, including information on species identity, capture location and sales price, were collected in a market survey. Species biological data, and the historical price of bushmeat and its substitutes (fish and domestic meat), were taken from the literature. The theoretical sustainable yield for each species was estimated using standard algorithms.3. We tested the hypothesis that the current trade is unsustainable with four predictions: that (1) the number of animals extracted exceeds a theoretical sustainable yield, (2) larger taxa are depleted more heavily close to the city, (3) the price of bushmeat has outstripped inflation and (4) the price of alternatives, such as domestic meat and fish, has fallen relative to the price of bushmeat. None of these predictions were supported. There was therefore no evidence of unsustainability.4. Analysis of market profiles and hunter reports suggest that the present pattern of sustainability is the result of a series of non-random extinctions from historical hunting. Vulnerable taxa (slow reproducers) have been depleted heavily in the past, so that only robust taxa (fast reproducers), such as rodents and small antelope, are now traded. These robust taxa are supplied from a predominantly agricultural landscape around the city.5. Synthesis and applications. The bushmeat trade can have a severe impact on species that are vulnerable to overexploitation. However, once these species have disappeared, the remaining species may be harvested sustainably. Bushmeat management policy might therefore be improved by adopting a two-pronged approach in which vulnerable species are protected from hunting, but robust species are allowed to supply a sustainable trade. The productivity of agricultural landscapes for many bushmeat species indicates that these areas may play an important role in supporting a sustainable bushmeat trade.",0021-8901,NA,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01046.x
oli_evaluation_2017,The Pan African medical journal,"An evaluation of the cold chain technology in {South}-{East}, {Nigeria} using {Immunogenicity} study on the measles vaccines.","Introduction: Vaccines are biological products and their efficacy is affected by storage conditions. They are vital in promoting public health. Failures in immunization programmes often times are blamed on disruption in vaccine cold-chain. This study assessed the immunogenicity/potency of the measles vaccines utilized in childhood immunization in South-East, Nigeria and indirectly assessed the effectiveness of the cold-chain technology in the region., Methods: This was an experimental study carried out between December 2011 and June 2013. Antibody induction method was used to evaluate the immunogenicity/potency of the measles vaccines sourced from the central cold chain facilities in South-east, Nigeria and indirectly, the effectiveness of the cold chain technology in the zone in maintaining vaccine potency. The neutralizing antibodies in a control group (administered with measles vaccines stored at 37degreeC for 12 months) and in immunized group were determined after 30 days of immunization using ELISA., Results: The mean storage temperature of the vaccines at the states vaccines central cold chain facilities was -2.4degreeC and before storage at study site, it was 5.8degreeC but at the study site it was -4.54degreeC. Mean +/-Standard Error in the Mean (SEM) IgG titers for the measles vaccines sourced from ""Open Market"", Ebonyi, Enugu, Imo, Anambra and Abia States were 0.793+/-0.051, 1.621+/-0.015, 1.621+/-0.015, 1.715+/-0.081, 1.793+/-0.051 and 1.683+/-0.078 respectively while the mean +/-Standard Error in the Mean (SEM) IgM titres were 0.857+/-0.037, 1.400+/-0.030, 1.391+/-0.032, 1.339+/-0.037, 1.405+/-0.066 and 1.279+/-0.025 respectively. One way analysis of variance shows that there is statistical difference in the IgG and IgM antibodies titers produced by the control compared to the vaccines (P value {\textless} 0.0001). Also, Bartlett's test for equal variances showed that there was statistical difference (P value {\textless} 0.0001 for IgG and = 0.036 for IgM). The antibodies elicited by the vaccines from the states were enough to confer protection but the vaccine samples from ""Open Market"" (control) could not evoke enough antibodies., Conclusion: The cold-chain technology in the region was judged to be optimal as at the time of vaccine sampling since all the measles vaccines had good immunogenicity profile. However, efforts are still needed to maintain these facilities in good condition in order to ensure effective immunization program in the region.",1937-8688,NA,10.11604/pamj.supp.2017.27.3.11491

A total of 133 genetically determined specimens were used for the morphometric analyses. Statistical analyses clearly demonstrated that the three species largely overlapped in centroid size (M. erythroleucus tends to be larger on average than the M. huberti and M. natalensis) but they exhibited large differences in skull shape. The current study focused on skull shape, and allowed us to discriminate three morphological groups that are congruent with the three species suggested by molecular identification (90\% of the individuals are correctly assigned by cross-validated classifications). In the Mastomys, the evolution of cranial length and shape may be influenced by competitive pressure between closely related species separated by ecological segregation. This source of variability could possibly induce character displacement between species of Mastomys.",1768-3238,NA,10.1016/j.crvi.2008.11.004
hagen_digesta_2018,MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY,"Digesta kinetics in two arvicoline rodents, the field vole ({Microtus} agrestis) and the steppe lemming ({Lagurus} lagurus)","A large number of small mammals practice cecotrophy, i.e. ingesting a certain fraction of their own faeces typically termed `cecotrophs'. This behaviour is generally thought to limit metabolic losses of nitrogen, because a colonic separation mechanism (CSM) selectively accretes fine, nitrogen-rich particles (such as microbes) in the cecotrophs. Two types of CSM have been described, a wash-back CSM (in lagomorphs) where fluids wash through the colonic digesta in a retrograde manner into the caecum, resulting in a selectively prolonged solute marker retention in passage studies; and a mucus-trap CSM (in hystricomorph rodents) where microbes are trapped in mucus-filled anatomical structures in the colon mucosa (grooves/furrows/folds). In the mucus-trap CSM, no selective retention of any passage marker occurs. How the CSM operates in muroid rodents is not well explored, but both mucus-filled anatomical structures and a moderate degree of selective solute marker retention have been reported in the literature. Here we demonstrate selective solute marker retention in two muroid, arvicoline rodent species (field voles Microtus agrestis, body mass 28.6 +/- 7.4 g, and steppe lemming Lagurus lagurus, 19.8 +/- 2.0 g) on a pelleted high-fibre diet, where a solute marker was retained 20-55\% longer than a particle marker (with mean retention times of 5.6 +/- 0.5 vs. 4.8 +/- 0.9 and 5.0 +/- 1.5 vs. 3.3 +/- 0.9 h, respectively). The animals achieved an apparent organic matter digestibility similar to that of much larger herbivores on diets of similar fibre content. In addition to a selective feeding behaviour and a high relative food intake, a digestive physiology that includes coprophagy, and a CSM using both mucus-trap and wash-back effects, are characteristic for herbivorous arvicoline rodents. The relative contributions of the two CSM components - whether they have additive or complementary effects - remain to be explored. (C) 2018 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde.

thompson_relationship_1993,JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY,RELATIONSHIP} {OF} {DESCENDING} {INFERIOR} {COLLICULUS} {PROJECTIONS} {TO} {OLIVOCOCHELAR} {NEURONS,"With the objective of defining the relationship of descending inferior colliculus projections to the olivocochlear system in the guinea pig, inferior colliculus neurons were anterogradely labeled with Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin and olivocochlear neurons were retrogradely labeled with horseradish peroxidase in the same brain sections. Inferior colliculus neurons were found to project to many nuclei and regions of the hindbrain where olivocochlear neurons reside. The most substantial of these descending projections was to the ipsilateral medioventral periolivary region. Fewer descending projections terminated in the ipsilateral ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, superior paraolivary nucleus, and rostral periolivary region; and even fewer ipsilateral projections terminated in the area surrounding the lateral superior olive, caudal periolivary region, and the lateroventral periolivary region. Descending neurons of the inferior colliculus also project to the contralateral hindbrain first via the lateral lemniscus and then the trapezoid body, to terminate in the contralateral medioventral periolivary region, superior paraolivary nucleus, rostral periolivary region, and the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus. In addition to the projections into these regions that contain olivocochlear neurons, there are varicosities of inferior colliculus neurons that appear to contact the olivocochlear neurons themselves, both ipsilaterally and contralaterally, especially, but not only, in the ipsilateral medioventral periolivary region. We therefore conclude that descending inferior colliculus neurons do provide input to olivocochlear neurons and that the input is not limited to olivocochlear neurons of the ipsilateral medioventral periolivary region. However, given the robust nature of the projection to the ipsilateral medioventral periolivary region and the paucity of contacts observed in that region, we also conclude that the olivocochlear neuron is not the major target of descending inferior colliculus projections.

During this period, influenza activity was increasing across the country and was much greater than during the same period in previous years, with great harm to people's health. Methods In this study, we isolated two human influenza virus strains-A/Hebei/F076/2018(H1N1) and B/Hebei/16275B/2018-from patients with severe influenza in Hebei, China, during the flu season in January 2018, and explored their genetic characteristics, pathogenicity, and transmissibility. Results A/Hebei/F076/2018(H1N1) belongs to the human-like H1N1 influenza virus lineage, whereas B/Hebei/16275B/2018 belongs to the Victoria lineage and is closely related to the World Health Organization reference strain B/Brisbane/60/2008. Pathogenicity tests revealed that A/Hebei/F076/2018(H1N1) replicated much more strongly in mice, with mice exhibiting 40\% mortality, whereas B/Hebei/16275B/2018 was not lethal. Both viruses could be transmitted through direct contact and by the aerosol route between guinea pigs, but the H1N1 strain exhibited higher airborne transmissibility.

brain_intermittent_2002,JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON,Intermittent {ATP} release from nerve terminals elicits focal smooth muscle {Ca2}+ transients in mouse vas deferens,"A confocal Ca2+ imaging technique has been used to detect ATP release from individual sympathetic varicosities on the same nerve terminal branch. Varicose nerve terminals and smooth muscle cells in mouse vas deferens were loaded with the Ca2+ indicator Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1. Field (nerve) stimulation evoked discrete, focal increases in [Ca2+] in smooth muscle cells adjacent to identified varicosities. These focal increases in [Ca2+] have been termed `neuroeffector Ca2+ transients' (NCTs). NCTs were abolished by alpha,beta-methylene ATP (1 mum), but not by nifedipine (1 muM) or prazosin (100 nm), suggesting that NCTs are generated by Ca2+ influx through P2X receptors without a detectable contribution from L-type Ca2+ channels or alpha(1)-adrenoceptor-mediated pathways. Action potential-evoked ATP release was highly intermittent (mean probability 0.019 +/- 0.002; range 0.001-0.10) at 1 Hz stimulation, even though there was no failure of action potential propagation in the nerve terminals. Twenty-eight per cent of varicosities failed to release transmitter following more than 500 stimuli. Spontaneous ATP release was very infrequent (0.0014 Hz). No Ca2+ transient attributable to noradrenaline release was detected even in response to 5 Hz stimulation. There was evidence of local noradrenaline release as the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine increased the probability of occurrence of NCTs by 55 +/- 21 \% during trains of stimuli at 1 Hz. Frequency-dependent facilitation preferentially occurred at low probability release sites. The monitoring of NCTs now allows transmitter release to be detected simultaneously from each functional varicosity on an identified nerve terminal branch on an impulse-to-impulse basis.",0022-3751,NA,10.1113/jphysiol.2002.019612

After acute oral administration it reduced arterial blood pressure dose dependently in normotensive sodium-depleted and cyclosporin-induced hypertensive squirrel monkeys, starting with the minimal oral dose of 3 mu g/kg. Daily oral doses of 1 mu g/kg showed a progressive blood pressure decrease, with a maximal response reached after 1 week. The drug could also be applied transdermally with similar hemodynamic effects without any decrease of plasma renin activity or plasma immunoreactive angiotensin II.

debrah_doxycycline_2006,PLOS PATHOGENS,Doxycycline reduces plasma {VEGF}-c/{sVEGFR}-3 and improves pathology in lymphatic filariasis,"Lymphatic filariasis is a disease of considerable socioeconomic burden in the tropics. Presently used antifilarial drugs are able to strongly reduce transmission and will thus ultimately lower the burden of morbidity associated with the infection, however, a chemotherapeutic principle that directly induces a halt or improvement in the progression of the morbidity in already infected individuals would constitute a major lead. In search of such a more-effective drug to complement the existing ones, in an area endemic for bancroftian filariasis in Ghana, 33 microfilaremic and 18 lymphedema patients took part in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a 6-wk regimen of 200 mg/day doxycycline. Four months after doxycycline treatment, all patients received 150 -200 mu g/kg ivermectin and 400 mg albendazole. Patients were monitored for Wolbachia and microfilaria loads, antigenemia, filarial dance sign (FDS), dilation of supratesticular lymphatic vessels, and plasma levels of lymphangiogenic factors (vascular endothelial growth factor-C [VEGF-C] and soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 [(s) VEGFR-3]). Lymphedema patients were additionally monitored for stage (grade) of lymphedema and the circumferences of affected legs. Wolbachia load, microfilaremia, antigenemia, and frequency of FDS were significantly reduced in microfilaremic patients up to 24 mo in the doxycycline group compared to the placebo group. The mean dilation of supratesticular lymphatic vessels in doxycycline-treated patients was reduced significantly at 24 mo, whereas there was no improvement in the placebo group. Preceding clinical improvement, at 12 mo, the mean plasma levels of VEGF-C and sVEGFR-3 decreased significantly in the doxycycline-treated patients to a level close to that of endemic normal values, whereas there was no significant reduction in the placebo patients. The extent of disease in lymphedema patients significantly improved following doxycycline, with the mean stage of lymphedema in the doxycycline-treated patients being significantly lower compared to placebo patients 12 mo after treatment. The reduction in the stages manifested as better skin texture, a reduction of deep folds, and fewer deep skin folds. In conclusion, a 6-wk regimen of antifilarial treatment with doxycycline against W. bancrofti showed a strong macrofilaricidal activity and reduction in plasma levels of VEGF-C/sVEGFR-3, the latter being associated with amelioration of supratesticular dilated lymphatic vessels and with an improvement of pathology in lymphatic filariasis patients.",1553-7366,NA,10.1371/journal.ppat.0020092
griffiths_nadh_1998,BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY,NADH} fluorescence in isolated guinea-pig and rat cardiomyocytes exposed to low or high stimulation rates and effect of metabolic inhibition with cyanide,"In this study we investigated whether NADH fluorescence levels changed in response to low or high rates of electrical stimulation in single ventricular myocytes isolated from rat and guinea-pig hearts, either Juring a single contraction or upon sustained electrical stimulation of cells. NADH levels were determined from cell autofluorescence and cell length monitored using an edge-tracking device. NADH/NAD(+) was obtained by addition of cyanide, 100\% NADH, and carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxy phenylhydrazone (FCCP), 100\% NAD(+). Rat myocytes exhibited slightly higher resting fluorescence levels than guinea-pig cells; however, NADH/NAD(+) was higher in rat than guinea-pig cells (P {\textless} 0.05), 24.3 +/- 4.3 (N = 17) vs 14.6 +/- 1.6 (N = 17), respectively. There was no change in NADH fluorescence during a single contraction when cells were stimulated at either low (0.2 Hz) or high (3 Hz) rates in either species. Furthermore, NADH levels did not change upon sustained stimulation at 3 Hz in either species. Metabolic blockade with cyanide induced a dose dependent rise in NADH fluorescence which was similar for both rat and guinea-pig myocytes and reached a maximum at greater than or equal to 1 mM of cyanide. Although a full recovery of NADH fluorescence was seen in both types of cells after brief exposure to cyanide, the rate of recovery was significantly slower in rat myocytes; times to 90\% recovery were 110 +/- 29 sec, N = 6, and 264 +/- 50 sec, N = 6, for guinea-pig and rat cells, respectively.

olayemi_widespread_2018-2,PARASITES \& VECTORS,"Widespread arenavirus occurrence and seroprevalence in small mammals, {Nigeria","Background: Lassa fever, killing thousands of people annually, is the most reported viral zoonotic disease in Nigeria. Recently, different rodent species carrying diverse lineages of the Lassa virus (LASV) in addition to a novel Mobala-like genetic sequence were detected within the country. Here, screening 906 small mammal specimens from 11 localities for IgG antibodies and incorporating previous PCR detection data involving the same populations, we further describe arenavirus prevalence across Nigeria in relation to host species and geographical location. Methods: Small mammals were trapped during the period 2011-2015 according to geographical location (endemic and non endemic zones for Lassa fever), season (rainy and dry seasons between 2011 and 2012 for certain localities) and habitat (indoois, peridomestic settings and sylvatic vegetation). identification of animal specimens from genera such as Mastomys and Mus (Nannomys) was assisted by DNA sequencing. Small mammals were tested for LASV IgG antibody using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Results: Small mammals were infected in both the endemic and non-endemic zones for Lassa fever, with a wider range of species IgG-positive (n = 8) than those which had been previously detected to be PCR-positive (n = 3). IgG-positive species, according to number of infected individuals, were Mastomys natalensis (n = 40), Mastomys erythroleucus (n = 15), Praomys daltoni (n = 6), Mus baoulei (n = 5), Rattus rattus (n = 2), Crocidura spp. (n = 2), Mus minutoides (n = 1) and Praomys misonnei (n = 1). Multimammate mice (Mastomys natalensis and M. erythroleucus) were the most ubiquitously infected, with animals testing positive by either PCR or IgG in 7 out of the 11 localities sampled IgG prevalence in M. natalensis ranged from 1\% in Abagboro, 17-36\% in Eguare Egoro, Ekpoma and Ngel Nyaki, up to 52 \% in Mayo Ranewo. Prevalence according to locality, season and age was not, however, statistically significant for M. natalensis in Eguare Egoro and Ekpoma, localities that were sampled longitudinally. Conclusions: Overall, our study demonstrates that arenavirus occurrence is probably more widely distributed geographically and in extent of host taxa than is currently realized. This expanded scope should be taken into consideration in Lassa fever control efforts. further sampling should also be carried out to isolate and characterize potential arenaviruses present in small mammal populations we found to be seropositive.",1756-3305,NA,10.1186/s13071-018-2991-5

brouat_host_2007-3,PARASITOLOGY,Host ecology and variation in helminth community structure in {Mastomys} rodents from {Senegal,"We studied patterns of variation in parasite communities of 2 closely related species of Mastomys rodents. These 2 species live in sympatry in South-eastern Senegal, but differ drastically in their habitat choice. We asked (a) whether the host species have the same parasites; (b) whether there is any observable pattern relative to the host species/habitat type in the structure of parasite communities; (c) whether the variability in parasite community for each host species is related to habitat characteristics. We analysed 220 and 264 individuals of each host species, sampled respectively in 10 and 11 trap sites. Twenty parasite taxa were recorded, and the majority were nematodes. Between-host species comparisons showed that helminth communities were slightly more diversified in M. natalensis. Many parasite species were found in both Mastomys. However, various helminth taxa varied in frequency and abundance between host species. Within each host species, helminth diversity, prevalence and/or abundance of some parasites were correlated with habitat or host population factors that may influence parasite life-cycles, such as village structure, or the presence/absence of a pool. Our results suggest that habitat characteristics have a strong impact on helminth community structure.",0031-1820,NA,10.1017/S003118200600151X

The antiplasmodial activity of extracts was evaluated using the measurement of the plasmodial lactate dehydrogenase activity on chloroquine-sensitive (3D7) and resistant (W2) strains of Plasmodium falciparum. The selectivity of the different extracts was evaluated using the MTT test on J774 macrophage-like murine cells and WI38 human normal fibroblasts., RESULTS: The best growth inhibition of both strains of Plasmodium falciparum was observed with the dichloromethane extracts of Acanthospermum hispidum DC.

chandramathi_urinary_2010,PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH,Urinary hyaluronidase activity in rats infected with {Blastocystis} hominis-evidence for invasion?,"The fact whether Blastocystis hominis can invade has always been in question. Apart from a few sporadic studies such as that done on gnotobiotic guinea pigs which showed surface invasion and mucosal inflammation of the host's intestine caused by B. hominis infection, no real documentation of invasion has been proven. Studies have shown that hyaluronidase is secreted during the penetration into the host's skin and gut by nematode parasites. Hyaluronidase activity in protozoa namely Entamoeba histolytica has also been described previously. This study attempts to determine hyaluronidase in urine samples of B. hominis-infected rats. The presence of hyaluronidase in urine provides an indirect evidence of invasion by B. hominis into colonic epithelium causing the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins namely hyaluronic acid (HA). HA is depolymerized by hyaluronidase which may be used by organisms to invade one another. In this study, the levels of urinary hyaluronidase of Sprague-Dawley rats infected with B. hominis were monitored for 30 days. Hyaluronidase levels in the infected rats were significantly higher on days 28 and 30 compared to the day before inoculation (P {\textless} 0.01 and P {\textless} 0.05, respectively). During this stage, parasitic burden in infected stools was also at a high level. Proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-6 and interleukin-8, were also significantly higher (P {\textless} 0.05) in the serum of infected rats. The study demonstrates that since no other pathogen was present and that amoeboid forms of the parasites have been shown to exist previously, the elevated levels of hyaluronidase in this preliminary finding suggests that the organism is capable of having invasion or penetration activity in the hosts' intestine.",0932-0113,NA,10.1007/s00436-010-1825-y
pouyatos_lipoic_2008,JOURNAL OF REHABILITATION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,Lipoic acid and 6-formylpterin reduce potentiation of noise-induced hearing loss by carbon monoxide: {Preliminary} investigation,"Potentiation of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) by specific chemical contaminants and therapeutic drugs represents a distinct public health risk. Prediction of chemicals that yield such potentiation has not been successful because such agents differ markedly in structure. One mechanism for this potentiation that has garnered support is oxidative injury to the cochlea. Thus far, limited data have been published in support of this hypothesis. The current experiment was designed to further test this model using two antioxidant compounds, lipoic acid (LA) and 6-formylpterin (6-FP), and determine whether they would block potentiation of NIHL resulting from simultaneous exposures to carbon monoxide (CO) and noise in rats. Neither CO nor noise exposure at the intensity and duration selected produce persistent auditory impairment by themselves. Different groups of rats were exposed to noise alone centered at 8.0 kHz (105 dB) for 2 hours or to combined CO + noise treatment consisting of CO exposure for 1.5 hours and then exposure to CO + noise for 2 hours. Additional groups received either LA (100 mg/kg) or 6-FP (14 mg/kg) 30 minutes prior to the onset of CO + noise. Cochlear function was monitored using distortion product otoacoustic emissions, and auditory thresholds were assessed using compound action potentials recorded from the round window. Histopathological evaluation of the organ of Corti provided counts of missing hair cells in each treatment group. The CO + noise-exposure group replicated previous studies in demonstrating permanent impairment of cochlear function and associated outer hair cell loss that greatly exceeded the minimal losses observed in the group treated with noise alone. Both LA and 6-FP given 30 minutes prior to the onset of CO + noise exposure reduced cochlear impairment and loss of hair cells.",0748-7711,NA,10.1682/JRRD.2007.12.0200
cremers_is_2001,BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY,Is the beneficial antidepressant effect of coadministration of pindolol really due to somatodendritic autoreceptor antagonism?,"Background: We investigated the combination of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) with the beta -adrenoceptor/serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) antagonist pindolol, based on the concept that 5-HT1A receptor blockade would eliminate the need for desensitization of presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors and therefore hasten the onset of action and improve the efficacy of SSRIs. However, since pindolol plasma levels after 2.5 mg three times a day are about 60 nmol/L, and the K-i for the 5-HT1A receptor is 30 nmol/L, it is questionable whether pindolol levels in the brain would be sufficient to antagonize 5-HT1A receptors. Using microdialysis in the guinea pig, we correlated brain and plasma levels of pindolol with its capability of augmenting paroxetine-induced increases in brain 5-HT levels. In addition, central beta -receptor antagonism of pindolol was studied by investigating blockade of beta -agonist-induced increases in brain cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) formation. Methods: Using microdialysis and jugular vein catheterization, we studied the ability of systemically administered pindolol to antagonize central 5-HT1A and beta -adrenoceptors, while simultaneously monitoring pindolol plasma and brain concentrations. Results: Augmentation of paroxetine-induced increases in extracellular 5-HT levels in the ventral hippocampus was only observed at steady stare plasma levels exceeding 7000 nmol/L (concurrent brain levels 600 nmol/L). In contrast, antagonism of beta -agonist-induced increases of brain cAMP levels was already observed at pindolol plasma levels of 70 nmol/L (concurrent brain levels {\textless} 3 nmol/L) Conclusions: At plasma levels that are observed in patients after 2.5 mg three times a day ({\textless}similar to{\textgreater}60 nmol/L), pindolol produces only a partial blockade of presynaptic 5-HT1A autoreceptors and does not augment the SSRI-induced 5-HT increase in the guinea pig brain. It is therefore very unlikely that the favorable effects of combining pindolol with SSRIs, as reported in a number of clinical studies, are due to 5-HT1A antagonism. Since pindolol completely blocks central beta -adrenoreceptors at clinically relevant plasma levels, it is possible that beta -adrenoceptor antagonism is involved in mediating pindolol's beneficial effects.

The data were collected from two processing slabs located in Odo-Ona, Kekere in Oluyole Local Government Area and Asejire in Egbeda Local Government Area between May 2007 and February 2008. A total of 6079 carcasses of grasscutters in ten months, were examined in the processing locations. The number of grasscutters caught was significantly higher (p{\textless}0.05) in the dry season (4521) than in the rainy season (1558). The mean body weight of the grasscutters were not significantly different (P{\textgreater}0.05) in the stock of carcasses examined in the two seasons. The males tend to weigh more (4.6kg and4.9kg) than the females (3.4kg and 3.6kg) in both seasons. There was a strong positive correlation between the body weight and standard length of the adult grasscutters carcasses in the two seasons. Grasscutters in the range of 0.5-1.4 kg were rarely caught in rainy season and only few were caught in dry season. The large sized grasscutters (8.0-8.4 kg) were caught in dry season and none was caught in rainy season. Accordingly, this study concludes that there were seasonal variations in the population of grasscutters captured through hunting.",2248-9215,NA,NA

Intravital fluorescence microscopy was used to monitor leukocyte adherence and emigration, platelet-leukocyte aggregation, mast cell degranulation, and albumin leakage after release of a 20-min arterial occlusion. I/R elicited large increases in leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion and albumin leakage. These responses were significantly attenuated in venules treated with either superoxide dismutase, oxypurinol (an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase), lodoxamide (a mast cell stabilizer), WEB-2086 (a platelet-activating factor antagonist), or SC-41930 (a leukotriene B-4-receptor antagonist) but not by U-74006F (an inhibitor of lipid peroxidation). Platelet-leukocyte aggregates and mast cell degranulation induced by I/R were also attenuated by administration of either superoxide dismutase or lodoxamide. These results support the hypothesis that oxidants produced, in part, by xanthine oxidase promote the formation (by mast cells and endothelial cells) of platelet-activating factor and leukotriene Bq, which recruit and activate leukocytes in postischemic venules. The adherent and emigrated leukocytes then mediate the increased albumin extravasation observed in the postcapillary venules.",0363-6135,NA,NA

In May 2011, six fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) in Clinton State Park, Kansas, US were euthanized after exhibiting clinical signs of neurologic disease. Postmortem examination of two squirrels revealed that these individuals died of Baylisascaris larva migrans, which resulted in meningoencephalitis and variable pneumonia and myocarditis. Fecal flotation of raccoon (Procyon lotor) feces collected in the area revealed Baylisascaris sp. ova, presumably Baylisascaris procyonis, in one of nine samples. Additional fox squirrel carcasses were submitted for diagnostic evaluation from eastern Kansas for 1 yr following the Baylisascaris sp. outbreak. This monitoring unexpectedly resulted in the detection of Francisella tularensis, the zoonotic pathogen that causes tularemia, in two fox squirrels. The increased attention to fox squirrel mortalities prompted by the outbreak of Baylisascaris sp. larva migrans revealed cases of tularemia that may not have been otherwise detected. Although F. tularensis is endemic in Kansas, the current distribution and prevalence of B. procyonis in raccoons and other hosts in Kansas are poorly understood.

Bladder biopsies were collected from eight BPH patients with compensated BOO and from eight non-obstructed patients. Detrusor areas were separated by laser capture microdissection microscopy, and extracted RNA was subjected to quantitative RT-PCR for connexin43 and connexin45. Furthermore, localization of connexin45 and lysosome membrane associated protein 1 was studied by immunohistochemistry. We found the human detrusor to express connexin45 rather than connexin43. Compared to controls, connexin45 expression was not significantly changed in detrusors of obstructed patients. However, connexin45 protein patterns were focally altered in obstruction. Our study is the first to provide evidence that connexin45-coupling of detrusor cells may be regionally impaired in patients with BOO due to BPH. The altered connexin45 coupling may contribute to LUTS.",0724-4983,NA,10.1007/s00345-008-0365-x

lashley_estimating_2018,Scientific Reports,Estimating wildlife activity curves: comparison of methods and sample size.,"Camera traps and radiotags commonly are used to estimate animal activity curves. However, little empirical evidence has been provided to validate whether they produce similar results. We compared activity curves from two common camera trapping techniques to those from radiotags with four species that varied substantially in size ([approximately]1 kg-[approximately]50 kg), diet (herbivore, omnivore, carnivore), and mode of activity (diurnal and crepuscular). Also, we sub-sampled photographs of each species with each camera trapping technique to determine the minimum sample size needed to maintain accuracy and precision of estimates. Camera trapping estimated greater activity during feeding times than radiotags in all but the carnivore, likely reflective of the close proximity of foods readily consumed by all species except the carnivore (i.e., corn bait or acorns). However, additional analyses still indicated both camera trapping methods produced relatively high overlap and correlation to radiotags. Regardless of species or camera trapping method, mean overlap increased and overlap error decreased rapidly as sample sizes increased until an asymptote near 100 detections which we therefore recommend as a minimum sample size. Researchers should acknowledge that camera traps and radiotags may estimate the same mode of activity but differ in their estimation of magnitude in activity peaks.",2045-2322,NA,NA

Following a single-step liquid-liquid extraction of plasma samples using chloroform, 7-hydroxymitragynine and the internal standard (tryptoline) were separated on an Acquity UPLCTM BEH C-18 (1.7 mu m, 2.1x50mm) column using an isocratic elution at a flow rate of 0.2mL/min. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1\% acetic acid in water and 0.1\% acetic acid in acetonitrile (10:90, v/v). The run time was 2.5min. The analysis was carried out under the multiple reaction-monitoring mode using positive electrospray ionization. Protonated ions [M+H](+) and their respective product ions were monitored at the following transitions: 415190 for 7-hydroxymitragynine and 173144 for the internal standard.

The intrinsic activity of 5-HT receptor ligands was compared with that determined previously at the human recombinant 5-HT(1B) (h 5-HT(1B)) receptor under similar experimental conditions. 2 Membrane preparations of C6-glial/gp 5-HT(1B) cells exhibited [(3)H]-5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) and [(3)H]- N- [4-methoxy-3,4-methylpiperazin-1-yl) phenyl]-3-methyl-4-(4-pyridinyl)benzamide (GR 125743) binding sites with a pK(d) of 9.62 to 9.85 and a B(max),,, between 2.1 to 6.4 fmol mg(-1) protein. The binding affinities of a series of 5-HT receptor ligands determined with [(3)H]-5-CT and [(3)H]-GR 125743 were similar. Ligand affinities were comparable to and correlated (r(2): 0.74, P{\textless}0.001) with those determined at the recombinant h 5-HT(1B) receptor. 3 [(35)S]-GTP gamma S binding to membrane preparations of C6-glial/gp 5-HT(1B) cells was stimulated by the 5-HT receptor agonists that were being investigated. The maximal responses of naratriptan, zolmitriptan, sumatriptan, N-methyl-3-[pyrrolidin-2(R)-ylmethyl]-1H-indol-5-ylmethylsulphonamide (CP 122638), rizatriptan and dihydroergotamine were between 0.76 and 0.85 compared to 5-HT. The potency of these agonists showed a positive correlation (r(2): 0.72, P=0.015) with their potency at the recombinant h 5-HT(1B) receptor. 1-naphthylpiperazine, (+/-)-cyanopindolol and (2'-methyl-4'-(5-methyl[1,2,4] oxadiazole-3-yl)biphenyl-4-carboxylic acid [4-methoxy-3-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]amide (GR 127935) elicited an even smaller response (E(max): 0.32 to 0.63). 4 The ligands 1'-methyl-5-(2'-methyl-4'-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazole-3-yl) biphenyl-4-carbonyl)-2,3,6,7-tetrahydrospiro [furo[2,3-f]indole-3-spiro-4'-piperidine] (SB224289), methiothepin and ritanserin displayed inhibition of basal [(35)S]-GTP gamma S binding at concentrations relevant to their binding affinity for the gp 5-HT(1B) receptor. Methiothepin and SB224289 behaved as competitive antagonists at gp 5-HT(1B) receptors; pA(2) values were 9.74 and 8.73, respectively when 5-HT was used as an agonist. These estimates accorded with the potencies measured in antagonism of zolmitriptan-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP formation. Ketanserin acted as a weak antagonist (pK(B): 5.87) at gp 5-HT(1B) receptors. 5 In conclusion, the recombinant gp 5-HT(1B) receptor shares important pharmacological similarities with the recombinant h 5-HT(1B) receptor. The finding that negative activity occurs at these receptors further suggests that SB224289, methiothepin and ritanserin are likely to be inverse agonists.",0007-1188,NA,10.1038/sj.bjp.0701584

Clinical signs and survival rate were monitored. During the second lactation, daily milk yield was measured and milk composition was determined. In primiparous inoculated guinea-pigs, moderate (group 3)-to-severe acute mastitis (group 2) was produced. During subsequent lactation, milk yield in the control group peaked on day 5 and then decreased. Concentrations of Na+ and Cl- in milk, and concentrations of fat, gradually increased, but lactose and K+ decreased. After an early decrease, NAGase in milk increased towards the end of lactation. Except for higher NAGase concentrations in group 3, milk yield and composition during the second lactation did not differ significantly between the mastitis and the control groups.

lai_maturation_2010,JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY,Maturation of {Canal}-{Related} {Brainstem} {Neurons} in the {Detection} of {Horizontal} {Angular} {Acceleration} in {Rats,"We examined the functional maturation of canal-related brainstem neurons in Sprague-Dawley rats at postnatal day (P)1 to adult. Conscious animals were subjected to cycles of angular acceleration and deceleration so as to selectively activate hair cells of the horizontal semicircular canals. Brainstem neurons were monitored for c-fos expression by immuno-hybridization histochemistry as an indicator of neuronal activation. Fos-immunoreactive canal-related neurons were identifiable from P4 onwards in the vestibular nucleus and downstream vestibular relay stations, prepositus hypoglossal nucleus, and inferior olive. In the vestibular nucleus and prepositus hypoglossal nucleus, the number of canal-related neurons increased progressively with age, reaching the adult level by P21. Those in the inferior olive increased in number from P4 to P14 but decreased significantly afterwards until adulthood. The topography was not clear in the vestibular nucleus and pre-positus hypoglossal nucleus. Canal-related neurons in P4-7 rats were spread throughout the rostrocaudal length of each subnucleus but clusters of canal-related neurons tended to form within specific subnuclei by P21. These were concentrated in the caudal halves of medial and spinal vestibular nuclei and the rostral parts of superior vestibular nucleus and prepositus hypoglossal nucleus. In the inferior olive, the topography was evident early in the course of development. Canal-related neurons were exclusively located in four subnuclei: dorsal medial cell column, dorsal cap, subnucleus A, and subnucleus C, but not in other subnuclei. Taken together, our data revealed the developmental profile of neuronal subpopulations within the horizontal canal system, thus providing an internal neural representation for postnatal coding of horizontal head rotations in spatial perception.

rampon_distribution_1996,NEUROSCIENCE,Distribution of glycine-immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers in the rat brain,"To localize glycinergic cell bodies and fibers in the rat brain, we developed a sensitive immunohistochemical method combining the use of specific glycine antibodies (Campistron G. et al. (1986) Brain Res. 376, 400-405; Wenthold R. J. et al. (1987) Neuroscience 22, 897-912) with the streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase technique and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine . 4HCl-nickel intensification. We confirmed the presence of numerous glycine-immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers in the cochlear nuclei, superior olivary complex, nucleus of the trapezoid body, cerebellar cortex, deep cerebellar nuclei and area postrema. For the first time in rats, we described a large to very large number of cell bodies in the medial vestibular ventral part, prepositus hypoglossal gracile, raphe magnus and sensory trigeminal nuclei. A large number of cells was also observed in the oral and caudal pontine, parvocellular, parvocellular pars alpha, gigantocellular and gigantocellular pars alpha reticular nuclei. In addition, glycine-immunoreactive cells were seen in the ambiguus and subtrigeminal nuclei, the lateral habenula and the subfornical organ. We also provide the first evidence in rats for a very large number of fibers in the trigeminal, facial, ambiguus and hypoglossal motor nuclei, all nuclei of the medullary and pontine reticular formation, and the raphe and trigeminal sensory nuclei. We further revealed the presence of a substantial number of fibers in regions where glycine was not considered as a main inhibitory neurotransmitter, such as the pontine nuclei, the periaqueductal gray, the mesencephalic reticular formation, the anterior pretectal nucleus, the intralaminar thalamic nuclei, the zona incerta, the fields of Forel, the parvocellular parts of the paraventricular nucleus, the posterior hypothalamic areas, the anterior hypothalamic area, and the lateral and medial preoptic areas. These results indicate that, in contrast to previous statements, glycine may be an essential inhibitory neurotransmitter not only in the lower brainstem and spinal cord, but also in the upper brainstem and the forebrain.

gilat_nasal_2003,ARCHIVES OF TOXICOLOGY,Nasal midazolam as a novel anticonvulsive treatment against organophosphate-induced seizure activity in the guinea pig,"Seizures and status epilepticus, which may contribute to brain injury, are common consequences of exposure to organophosphorus (OP) cholinesterase inhibitors. Effective management of these seizures is critical. To investigate the efficacy of nasal midazolam as an anticonvulsive treatment for OP exposure, as compared to intramuscular midazolam, guinea pigs were connected to a recording swivel for electrocorticograph (ECoG) monitoring and clinical observation. The experimental paradigm consisted of pyridostigmine pretreatment (0.1 mg/kg i.m.) 20 min prior to sarin exposure (1.2 x LD50, 56 mug/kg i.m.). One minute post-exposure, atropine (3 mg/kg i.m.) and TMB-4 (1 mg/kg i.m.) were administered. Within 3-8 min after sarin exposure all animals developed electrographic seizure activity (EGSA), with convulsive behavior. Treatment with midazolam (1 mg/kg i.m.) 10 min after the onset of EGSA abolished EGSA within 389 +/- 181 s. The same dose was not effective, in most cases, when given 30 min after onset. However, a higher dose (2 mg/kg) was found efficacious after 30 min (949 +/- 466 s). In contrast, nasal application of midazolam (1 mg/kg) was found most effective, with significant advantages, in amelioration of EGSA and convulsive behavior, when given 10 min (216 +/- 185 s) or 30 min (308 +/- 122 s) following the onset of EGSA (P {\textless} 0.001). Thus, nasal midazolam could be used as a novel, rapid and convenient route of application against seizure activity induced by nerve agent poisoning.",0340-5761,NA,10.1007/s00204-002-0425-8

A total of 2170 individuals, spread over 16 rodent species, were caught in a capture-mark-recapture study which covered both the dry and wet seasons. The more humid site (Tabora B) in the northern part of Serengeti had the highest diversity of rodents followed by the Mihale site at the western extension. The driest site at Robanda had the lowest overall species diversity. Diversity also varied between the three levels of conservation status whereby the UA had the least diversity while the NP, which enjoyed the highest level of conservation status, had the highest diversity of rodents. Unprotected Area and NP plots at Tabora B showed a rodent species similarity index of 40\%; all the other paired plots scored over 50\% similarity indices, suggesting that, within a site, species composition did not vary significantly between the three levels of conservation status. The Robanda site had the highest (56\%) overall abundance of rodents; Mihale and Tabora B sites had about the same level of rodent abundance (20 and 24\% respectively). For the Mihale site, Mastomys natalensis ranked first followed by Arvicanthis niloticus and Tatera robusta, each of which contained 40, 38 and 16\%, respectively, of all individuals caught at the site. For the Robanda site, the figures were 66\%A. niloticus, 22\%M. natalensis and 9\%T. robusta; while for the Tabora B site the scores were 37\%M. natalensis, 18\%T. robusta and 11\%Lemniscomys barbarus. The differences in diversity, species composition and population abundance appear to result largely from physiognomic vegetation types, and habitat perturbations caused by livelihood activities in Western Serengeti.",0141-6707,NA,10.1111/j.1365-2028.2006.00641.x
lu_h2s_2014,BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY,H2S} modulates duodenal motility in male rats via activating {TRPV1} and {KATP} channels,"Background and PurposeH(2)S induces vasodilatation by opening K-ATP channels but it may also affect other ion channels. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of H2S on intestinal motility in rats and its underlying mechanism. Experimental ApproachThe tension of intestinal muscle strips, afferent firing of intestinal mesenteric nerves, length of duodenal smooth muscle cells and whole-cell membrane potential of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were monitored. H2S-producing enzymes were located by immunofluorescence staining. Key resultsNaHS exerted early transient excitation and late long-lasting inhibition on the intestinal contraction. The excitation was attenuated by TRPV1 antagonists capsazepine, A784168, SB-366791 and NK1 receptor antagonist L703606, while the inhibition was attenuated by glibenclamide. NaHS increased duodenal afferent nerve firing and depolarized DRG neurons. These effects were reduced by capsazepine and A784168. NaHS relaxed isolated duodenal smooth muscle cells. The K-ATP channels were expressed in smooth muscle cells. Cystathionine -synthase and cystathionine -lyase were expressed in rat duodenal myenteric neurons. L-cysteine and S-adenosyl-L-methionine increased the contraction of duodenal muscle strips, an effect attenuated by capsazepine and L703606. Conclusions and ImplicationsNaHS induces biphasic effects on intestinal motility in rats while endogenous H2S only exerts an excitatory effect. This transient excitatory effect might be mediated by activation of TRPV1 channels in sensory nerve terminals with the consequent release of substance P. The long-lasting inhibitory effect might be mediated by activation of K-ATP channels in the smooth muscle cells. These findings reveal a novel mechanism for the excitatory effect of H2S on gastrointestinal motility.",0007-1188,NA,10.1111/bph.12562

Mastomys natalensis is a well-documented and major pest rodent species. In East Africa where it occurs outdoors, the species is characterized by marked population cycles. In contrast, it is mostly associated with humans in West Africa, and appears to live strictly indoors in the Sahel. Here, we have monitored the proportions of M. natalensis juveniles and sexually active adults within the city of Niamey, Niger. Our survey clearly shows that M. natalensis reproduces all year long, with no detectable seasonality. Altogether, our data confirm that reproduction may shift from seasonal to continuous when conditions are more favorable. They also suggest that the urban environment may represent an extreme habitat where resources are permanently available. From the perspective of rodent control in Niamey, our results highlight the need for a constant management policy that should be performed by public authorities.",0025-1461,NA,NA
nwanna_antioxidant_2007,Pakistan journal of biological sciences : PJBS,Antioxidant and hepatoprotective properties of polyphenol extracts from {Telfairia} occidentalis (fluted pumpkin) leaves on acetaminophen induced liver damage.,"In this study the antioxidant and hepatoprotective properties of free and bound polyphenols from Telfairia occidentalis (darkish green leafy vegetable popularly used in soup and folk medicine for the management of many diseases in Nigeria) leaves were compared. Free soluble polyphenols were extracted with 80\% acetone, while the bound polyphenols were extracted from the acid and alkaline hydrolyzed residue of the leaf from free soluble polyphenols using ethyl acetate. The total phenol, DPPH free radical scavenging ability and reducing property were determined; subsequently the ability of the extracts to prevent acetaminophen (megadose) induced liver damage in rats were also assessed. Change in serum Glutamate Oxaloacetate Transaminase (GOT), Glutamate Pyruvate Transaminase (GPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), albumin, total protein and bilirubin were also determined. The results of the study revealed that the free soluble polyphenols content in the vegetable were significantly higher (p{\textless}0.05) than the bound polyphenols. Also, the free soluble polyphenols had a significantly higher antioxidant activity as typified by their higher reducing Power (0.28 OD700) and free radical scavenging ability (83.3\%) than the bound polyphenols [reducing power (0.22 OD700), free radical scavenging ability (66.6\%)]. Daily intubation of wistar strain albino rat's with 100 mg/mL/day for 7 days caused a significant increase (p{\textless}0.05) in serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Glutamate Oxaloacetate Transaminase (GOT) and Glutamate Pyruvate Transaminase (GPT), while there was no significant change (p{\textgreater}0.05) in serum bilirubin, albumin, globulin and total proteins in the rats. However, simultaneous intubations of some of the rat with 10 mg or 20 mg mL(-1) of T. occidentalis leaf extract (free soluble or bound polyphenols) along side with the acetaminophen caused a significant decrease (p{\textless}0.05) in serum ALP, GOT and GPT (except those intubated with bound polyphenols). Free soluble polyphenols had higher protective effect on the liver than the bound polyphenols; however there action were not dose-dependent. It could be inferred that both soluble free and bound polyphenols extracts of T. occidentails leaf have antioxidant and hepatoprotective properties, however soluble free polyphenols had significantly higher antioxidant and hepatoprotective properties than the bound polyphenols.",1028-8880,NA,NA

The study of the effect of the extract on the behavioural pattern of mice showed changes indicative of central nervous system depression. The results further revealed that the extract progressively reduced ephedrine-induced spontaneous motor activity in rats, and prolonged pentobarbitone-sleeping time in mice. Pre-treatment of mice with the extract also protected 40\% of the animals against pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsions.

As liver cancer causes at least 200,000 deaths per year, prevention measures must be developed to ameliorate this nearly always fatal disease. Preventive strategies will be facilitated by the identification of individuals at high risk. It is the goal of the molecular dosimetry field to provide facile and accurate biomarkers to identify people at high risk for carcinogen exposure and consequent adverse health effects. We have developed methods to detect the major aflatoxin DNA adduct, aflatoxin N7-guanine (AFB-N7-guanine), in urine, examined the dose-response characteristics in people living in China and The Gambia, and have found an excellent association of this biomarker with exposure. In addition to exposure studies in people, our laboratories have monitored AFB-N7-guanine excretion in the urine of rats whose risk for developing cancer has been modulated with dietary chemoprotective agents such that independent groups of animals receiving the same dosage of aflatoxin B1 were at either high or low risk for tumorigenesis. The production of DNA damage by aflatoxins is not the exclusive mechanism for liver cancer. Many other factors, including hepatitis B virus, cell proliferation, and nutritional status, can exert strong modification effects in human disease. Thus, molecular epidemiological investigations that examine only one biomarker may greatly underestimate or overestimate the risk for an individual. In our experimental studies, we have found the need to measure specific, biologically relevant metabolites in a urine sample. Our data show that the levels of the daily urinary excretion of total anatoxin metabolites are unrelated to risk of anatoxin-induced disease. Similar analyses using the human urine samples from China also revealed that total aflatoxin metabolites in urine do not reflect appropriate exposure assessments. In the rat model, AFB-N7-guanine is a minor, but biologically relevant, metabolite representing less than 1\% of the excreted material in urine, which does reflect exposure in experimental models. Thus, the composite human and experimental data generated from our research indicates that a cautious interpretation of the relationship between any biomarker and tumor outcome must be employed. However, both experimental rat data and human studies have also found that the AFB-N7-guanine adduct in urine is a good, noninvasive, short-term biomarker for determining both aflatoxin exposure and risk of genetic damage in target organs.",0091-6765,NA,10.2307/3431465
marien_households_2020,Emerging microbes \& infections,Households as hotspots of {Lassa} fever? {Assessing} the spatial distribution of {Lassa} virus-infected rodents in rural villages of {Guinea}.,"The Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis) is the reservoir host of Lassa virus (LASV), an arenavirus that causes Lassa haemorrhagic fever in humans in West Africa. While previous studies suggest that spillover risk is focal within rural villages due to the spatial behaviour of the rodents, the level of clustering was never specifically assessed. Nevertheless, detailed information on the spatial distribution of infected rodents would be highly valuable to optimize LASV-control campaigns, which are limited to rodent control or interrupting human-rodent contact considering that a human vaccine is not available. Here, we analysed data from a four-year field experiment to investigate whether LASV-infected rodents cluster in households in six rural villages in Guinea. Our analyses were based on the infection status (antibody or PCR) and geolocation of rodents (n = 864), and complemented with a phylogenetic analysis of LASV sequences (n = 119). We observed that the majority of infected rodents were trapped in a few houses (20\%) and most houses were rodent-free at a specific point in time (60\%). We also found that LASV strains circulating in a specific village were polyphyletic with respect to neighbouring villages, although most strains grouped together at the sub-village level and persisted over time. In conclusion, our results suggest that: (i) LASV spillover risk is heterogeneously distributed within villages in Guinea; (ii) viral elimination in one particular village is unlikely if rodents are not controlled in neighbouring villages. Such spatial information should be incorporated into eco-epidemiological models that assess the cost-efficiency of LASV control strategies.",2222-1751,NA,10.1080/22221751.2020.1766381

Aerosol models of filovirus infection have been developed in knock-out mice, guinea pigs and non-human primates; however, filovirus infection of immunocompetent mice by the aerosol route has not been reported. A murine model of aerosolized filovirus infection in mice should be useful for screening vaccine candidates and therapies. In this study, various strains of wild-type and immunocompromised mice were exposed to aerosolized wild-type (WT) or mouse-adapted (MA) Ebola virus (EBOV). Upon exposure to aerosolized WT-EBOV, BALB/c, C57BL/6 (B6), and DBA/2 (D2) mice were unaffected, but 100\% of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and 90\% of signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat1) knock-out (KO) mice became moribund between 7-9 days post-exposure (dpe). Exposure to MA-EBOV caused 15\% body weight loss in BALB/c, but all mice recovered. In contrast, 10-30\% lethality was observed in B6 and D2 mice exposed to aerosolized MA-EBOV, and 100\% of SCID, Stat1 KO, interferon (IFN)-gamma KO and Perforin KO mice became moribund between 7-14 dpe. In order to identify wild-type, inbred, mouse strains in which exposure to aerosolized MA-EBOV is uniformly lethal, 60 BXD (C57BL/6 crossed with DBA/2) recombinant inbred (RI) and advanced RI (ARI) mouse strains were exposed to aerosolized MA-EBOV, and monitored for disease severity. A complete spectrum of disease severity was observed. All BXD strains lost weight but many recovered. However, infection was uniformly lethal within 7 to 12 days post-exposure in five BXD strains. Aerosol exposure of these five BXD strains to 10-fold less MA-EBOV resulted in lethality ranging from 0\% in two strains to 90-100\% lethality in two strains. Analysis of post-mortem tissue from BXD strains that became moribund and were euthanized at the lower dose of MA-EBOV, showed liver damage in all mice as well as lung lesions in two of the three strains. The two BXD strains that exhibited 90-100\% mortality, even at a low dose of airborne MA-EBOV will be useful mouse models for testing vaccines and therapies. Additionally, since disease susceptibility is affected by complex genetic traits, a systems genetics approach was used to identify preliminary gene loci modulating disease severity among the panel BXD strains. Preliminary quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified that are likely to harbor genes involved in modulating differential susceptibility to Ebola infection.",NA,NA,10.3390/v4123468

rodas_circulating_2009,MEMORIAS DO INSTITUTO OSWALDO CRUZ,Circulating natural killer and gamma delta {T} cells decrease soon after infection of rhesus macaques with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus,"Rhesus macaques infected with the WE strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV-WE) serve as a model for human infection with Lassa fever virus. To identify the earliest events of acute infection, rhesus macaques were monitored immediately after lethal infection for changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Changes in CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD20 subsets did not vary outside the normal fluctuations of these blood cell populations; however, natural killer (NK) and gamma delta T cells increased slightly on day 1 and then decreased significantly after two days. The NK subsets responsible for the decrease were primarily CD3(-)CD8(+) or CD3(-)CD16(+) and not the NKT (primarily CD3(+)CD56(+)) subset. Macaques infected with a non-virulent arenavirus, LCMV-Armstrong, showed a similar drop in circulating NK and gamma delta T cells, indicating that this is not a pathogenic event. V gamma 9 T cells, representing the majority of circulating gamma delta T cells in rhesus macaques, displayed significant apoptosis when incubated with LCMV in cell culture; however, the low amount of cell death for virus-co-cultured NK cells was insufficient to account for the observed disappearance of this subset. Our observations in primates are similar to those seen in LCMV-infected mice, where decreased circulating NK cells were attributed to margination and cell death. Thus, the disappearance of these cells during acute hemorrhagic fever in rhesus macaques may be a cytokine-induced lymphopenia common to many virus infections.",0074-0276,NA,10.1590/S0074-02762009000400009

Various truncated NPY analogs were tested in the isolated guinea-pig caval vein where NPY is a vasoconstrictor (Y1 receptors) and in isolated rat vas deferens, by monitoring the suppression of electrically evoked contractions (Y2 receptors). The aim of this study was to define which parts of the NPY-(1-36) molecule were required to activate these receptors. NPY-(1-36), [Pro34]NPY and [Glu16,Ser18,Ala22,Leu28,31] NPY (ESALL-NPY), the latter being an analog with increased alpha-helicity in the 14-31 region, evoked vasoconstriction with similar potency and efficacy. Cyclic as well as linear NPY analogs having the 4 to 7 N-terminal amino acid residues linked to the 9 to 19 C-terminal residues by an 8-aminooctanoic acid (Aoc) residue were 25-50 times less potent than NPY-(1-36) itself. In the cyclic analogs, a disulfide bond was introduced to bring the N- and C-termini close together. Linear Aoc 2-27 -NPY was virtually inactive. The Y1 receptor needs an intact N-terminal end of NPY in order to become fully activated. The requirements for the C-terminus are less stringent, since substitutions in this part of the molecule resulted in fully active analogs. The central portion of the molecule may impose steric constraints on the N- and C-terminal ends, thereby facilitating Y1 receptor activation, but it does not seem to be essential for receptor recognition. NPY-(2-36) and NPY-(5-36) were only slightly less potent than the parent molecule in suppressing electrically evoked twitches in the vas deferens. ESALL-NPY was virtually equipotent with NPY-(1-36). [Aoc8-17]NPY and [Aoc5-24]NPY and the corresponding cyclic analogs effectively suppressed the stimulated twitches, but were about 10 times less potent than NPY-(1-36). [Aoc2-27]NPY was much less potent than the parent molecule. Substitution with proline in position 34 resulted in a marked loss of efficacy and potency. The results show that extensive N-terminal or central truncation does not greatly impair Y2 receptor recognition, whereas NPY analogs with proline in position 34 are poorly recognized. Hence, the Y2 receptor requires an intact NPY C-terminus, whereas demands for the N-terminal and mid-molecule parts are less stringent.",0014-2999,NA,10.1016/0014-2999(93)90784-F

The CCh-induced [Ca2+]c dynamics remained almost unchanged when 10 nM VIP of guinea pig was added 5 min after initiating the continuous stimulation with 1 0 muM CCh. The ineffectiveness of VIP on the CCh-induced [Ca 2+]c change was also confirmed in the records of mean [Ca 2+]c changes of several tens of acini. Continuous stimulation with 10 nM VIP alone caused no change in [Ca2+]c. Continuous stimulation with 1 00 muM CCh caused rapid [Ca 2+]c increase followed by gradual decrease during the stimulation. The CCh-induced [Ca2+]c remained unchanged when 10 nM VIP was added to HEPES-buffered Ringer solution containing 1 00 muM CCh. The ineffectiveness of VIP on the CCh-induced [Ca 2+]c change was also confirmed in the records of mean [Ca 2+]c changes of several tens of acini. The dose-response relation for CCh-induced amylase output showed that 1 0 nM VIP alone induced a definite increase in amylase output and that the simultaneous stimulation with various concentrations of CCh and 10 nM VIP caused an additive secretory effect. These results compatible with the view that there is little if any crosstalk between the CCh-induced [Ca 2+]c increase and the VIP-induced cyclic AMP increase in the processes of stimulus-secretion coupling in the pancreatic acinar cell of guinea pig.",0388-6107,NA,NA

Homologous Chromium-51-labelled platelets were used to monitor extracorporally the distribution of platelets in the circulation. For that purpose, collimated iodide scintillation detectors were placed above thorax (C1) and abdomen (C2). A dose-dependent increase in thoracic radioactivity, paralleled by a decrease in the abdomen, was observed after intravenous injection of ADP and collagen. This resulted in a shift of C1/C2, so that the effect of collagen was more pronounced (maximal increase of C1/C2 = 134\%) than ADP (maximal increase of C1/C2 = 79\%). The increase in thoracic radioactivity was caused by the uptake of platelets in the lung as was shown after administration of collagen (6-fold enrichment of labelled platelets). Lung platelet sequestration resulted in a dose-dependent thrombocytopenia. The ADP- and collagen-induced pulmonary platelet embolism reversibly provoked cardiovascular symptoms of shock: hypotension and bradycardia. Impaired gas exchange during platelet accumulation manifested itself in a reversible arterial hypoxaemia and hypercapnia, followed by a weak acidosis. We were able to inhibit ADP-dependent thoracic platelet accumulation by ticlopidine in a dose-related manner as well as collagen-induced thoracic platelet accumulation by acetylsalicylic acid. The results indicate that behaviour of homologous labelled rat platelets in vivo can easily be monitored, thus offering the opportunity to investigate the effects of antiaggregatory drugs on platelets in their natural environment.",0340-6245,NA,NA

basic_gnotobiotics_2019,LABORATORY ANIMALS,"Gnotobiotics: {Past}, present and future","Gnotobiotics or gnotobiology is a research field exploring organisms with a known microbiological state. In animal research, the development of gnotobiotics started in the late 19th century with the rederivation of germ-free guinea pigs. Cutting-edge achievements were accomplished by scientists in the Laboratories of Bacteriology at the University of Notre Dame (LOBUND). The primary goals of gnotobiotics were not only the development of the equipment required for long-term husbandry but also phenotypic characterization of germ-free animals. The first isolators were designed by Reynolds and Gustafsson as rigid-wall stainless steel autoclave-like chambers, which were subsequently replaced by Trexler's flexible-film polyvinyl plastic isolators. Flexible-film or semi-rigid isolators are commonly used today. The long-term maintenance of gnotobiotic rodents is performed in positive-pressure isolators. However, to facilitate gnotobiotic experimental procedures, short-term husbandry systems have been developed. Gnotobiotic animal husbandry is laborious and requires experienced staff. Germ-free animals can be rederived from existing rodent colonies by hysterectomy or embryo transfer. The physiology and anatomy of germ-free rodents are different from those of specified pathogen-free (SPF) rodents. Furthermore, to guarantee gnotobiotic status, the colonies need to be regularly microbiologically monitored. Today, gnotobiotics provides a powerful tool to analyse functional effects of host-microbe interactions, especially in complex disease models. Gnotobiotic models combined with `omics' approaches will be indispensable for future advances in microbiome research. Furthermore, these approaches will contribute to the development of novel therapeutic targets. In addition, regional or national gnotobiotic core facilities should be established in the future to support further applications of gnotobiotic models.",0023-6772,NA,10.1177/0023677219836715

carpentier_delta_2001,NEUROTOXICOLOGY,Delta activity as an early indicator for soman-induced brain damage: {A} review,"The organophosphorus (OP) compound soman is known to produce long-lasting epileptic seizure activity and associated brain damage. The present paper reviews the findings of five recent studies that tentatively established correlations between the development of soman-induced neuropathology and some subtle changes in the electrocortigraphic (ECoG) power spectrum. It is important tot note that the reported experiments have been performed independently by three different teams (France, The Netherlands, USA) in various animal models (rat, guinea-pig, cynomolgus monkey) through different protocols of intoxication, pharmacological environments, and methods for ECoG spectral analysis. Despite there disparities, the five studies show that a sustained shift of ECoG power toward the lowest frequency range, i.e. the delta band, occurs within the first hours of soman-induced seizures. This early ECoG spectral change is concurrent with the first neuropathological changes in brain and is almost constantly followed, days or weeks later, by at least minimal neuropathology. Moreover, the relative contribution of delta activity to the ECoG power spectrum still remains abnormally high for 1-3 days after seizure onset, i.e. within the phase of damage maturation. On the other hand, soman-induced neuropathology was not observed in non-seizuring animals in which the delta activity was not increased above the pre-soman baseline. Similarly, no brain damage was ever shown in seizuring subjects in which the initial delta change eventually normalized after the curative administration of efficient anticonvulsant drugs such as the non-competitive antagonists of the NMDA receptor. These results, in agreement with previously published observations, strongly suggest that an increase of the relative power in the delta band might be a real-time marker of the ongoing development of soman-induced, seizure-related cerebral lesions and a reliable predictor for the final neuronal losses to come. Therefore, the monitoring of delta activity during the 24-72 h period that follows soman exposure may potentially be a useful tool to follow â€œon-lineâ€  the progression of brain damage and to control the neuroprotective activity of a medication. Moreover, since the method is non-invasive in man and since the above-presented results have been partly found in primates, the applicability to spectral analysis as a prognostic means in human OP poisoning ought to be seriously considered.

Population growth and demographic shifts over the years have increased contact with these mammals, thereby increasing opportunities for disease transmission. In Africa, the burden of rodent-borne diseases is not well described. To investigate human seroprevalence of selected rodent-borne pathogens, sera from 657 healthy adults in ten rural communities in Ghana were analyzed. An in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to Lassa virus was positive in 34 (5\%) of the human samples. Using commercial kits, antibodies to hantavirus serotypes, Puumala and Dobrava, and Leptospira bacteria were detected in 11\%, 12\% and 21\% of the human samples, respectively. Forty percent of residents in rural farming communities in Ghana have measurable antibodies to at least one of the rodent-borne pathogens tested, including antibodies to viral hemorrhagic fever viruses. The high seroprevalence found in rural Ghana to rodent-borne pathogens associated with both sporadic cases and larger disease outbreaks will help define disease threats and inform public health policy to reduce disease burden in underserved populations and deter larger outbreaks.",1932-6203,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0215224

Sapelo Island herpetological fauna consisted of 44 species, representing 41\% of the 107 coastal mainland species. These included 12 frogs, two salamanders, one crocodilian, nine lizards, 15 snakes, and five turtles. Zooarchaeological herpetofaunal remains reported from three excavations on the island ware consistent with the modern fauna. Seven representative vegetational community types were surveyed: dune, high marsh edge, loblolly-slash pine (Pinus taeda and P. elliottii), pond pine (P. serotina), longleaf pine (P. palustris), and live oak (Quercus virginiana)-laurel oak (Q. hemisphaerica) maritime forest. Two different successional stages of managed loblolly-slash pine were examined (mid-age, 40-50 yr old; and mature, 80 + yr old). Highest herptile species richness, based on pitfall trapping, was observed in mature and mid-aged loblolly pine and live oak stands. Lowest herptile richness was observed in dunes, high marsh, and pond pine communities. Twenty-four species of mammals (representing 50\% of 48 species known from the adjacent mainland) were recorded from Sapelo Island. These included one marsupial, four insectivores, seven bats, one xenarthran, one lagomorph, five rodents, three carnivores, and two artiodactyls. Three mammalian species recorded from zooarchaeological remains, but not present today, included the fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), black bear (Ursus americana), and striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis). Significantly higher species richness values were observed for the mammal pitfall data in the mid-age loblolly and high marsh sites compared to mature loblolly, longleaf pine, pond pine, and live oak communities.

kulesza_physiological_2003,JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY,Physiological response properties of neurons in the superior paraolivary nucleus of the rat,"The superior paraolivary nucleus (SPON) is a prominent nucleus of the superior olivary complex. In rats, this nucleus is composed of a morphologically homogeneous population of GABAergic neurons that receive excitatory input from the contralateral cochlear nucleus and inhibitory input from the ipsilateral medial nucleus of the trapezoid body. SPON neurons provide a dense projection to the ipsilateral inferior colliculus and are thereby capable of exerting profound modulatory influence on collicular neurons. Despite recent interest in the structural and connectional features of SPON, little is presently known concerning the physiological response properties of this cell group or its functional role in auditory processing. We utilized extracellular, in vivo recording methods to study responses of SPON neurons to broad band noise, pure tone, and amplitude-modulated pure tone stimuli. Localization of recording sites within the SPON provides evidence for a medial ( high frequency) to lateral ( low frequency) tonotopic representation of frequencies within the nucleus. Best frequencies of SPON neurons spanned the audible range of the rat and receptive fields were narrow with V-shaped regions near threshold. Nearly all SPON neurons responded at the offset of broad band noise and pure tone stimuli. The vast majority of SPON neurons displayed very low rates of spontaneous activity and only responded to stimuli presented to the contralateral ear, although a small population showed binaural facilitation. Most SPON neurons also generated spike activity that was synchronized to sinusoidally amplitude-modulated tones. Taken together, these data suggest that SPON neurons may serve to encode temporal features of complex sounds, such as those contained in species-specific vocalizations.",0022-3077,NA,10.1152/jn.00547.2002

We calculated visual encounter rates (vER) and sign ER (sER) of mammalian taxa and hunting signs, mapped their locations and tested the hypothesis that sightings and signs of Primates occurred closer to the river Dodo in and near the gallery forest. We sighted nine taxa, including threatened King Colobus (Endangered, EN), Olive Colobus (Vulnerable, VU), Lowe's Monkey (VU), the Eastern Lesser Spot-nosed Monkey (VU), and White-bellied Pangolin (VU), with vER of 0.04, 0.12, 0.04, 0.12, 0.04, respectively.

The most frequently encountered signs were of the Red River Hog at 1.73 signs/km, and the Bushbuck at 0.63 signs/km. Remote cameras captured images of these two taxa at image capture rates (ICR) of 0.044 and 0.022, respectively. Images of the African Buffalo were captured at ICR of 0.044. The 23 confirmed taxa include seven Primates, four rodents, three carnivores, six even-toed ungulates, two pangolins and a Tree Hyrax. The mean distance from the river Dodo to the sightings and the signs of the Primates was significantly shorter than that of other taxa. This supports our hypothesis. There was a high level of hunting signs (sER = 0.63) indicating that intensive hunting pressure is menacing the fauna.

During exposure the respiratory minute volume and frequency were monitored. Blood samples were taken for gas chromatographic analysis of the nerve agent stereoisomers and for measurement of the activity of blood acetylcholinesterase (AChE). In all experiments, the concentration of (+)-sarin was below the detection limit ({\textless}5 pg/ml). The concentration-time profile of the toxic isomer, i.e., (-)-sarin, after an intravenous bolus was adequately described with a two-exponential equation. (-)-Sarin is distributed ca, 10-fold faster than C(-)P(-)-soman, whereas its elimination proceeds almost 10-fold slower, During nose-only exposure to 0.4 and 0.8 LCt50 of (+)-sarin in 8 min, (-)-sarin appeared to be rapidly absorbed. The blood AChE activity decreased during the exposure period to ca. 15 and 70\% of control activity, respectively. There were no effects on the respiratory parameters.

campbell_aberrant_2016,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-GASTROINTESTINAL AND LIVER PHYSIOLOGY,Aberrant fecal flora observed in guinea pigs with pressure overload is mitigated in animals receiving vagus nerve stimulation therapy,"Altered gut microbial diversity has been associated with several chronic disease states, including heart failure. Stimulation of the vagus nerve, which innervates the heart and abdominal organs, is proving to be an effective therapeutic in heart failure. We hypothesized that cervical vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) could alter fecal flora and prevent aberrations observed in fecal samples from heart failure animals. To determine whether microbial abundances were altered by pressure overload (PO), leading to heart failure and VNS therapy, a VNS pulse generator was implanted with a stimulus lead on either the left or right vagus nerve before creation of PO by aortic constriction. Animals received intermittent, open-loop stimulation or sham treatment, and their heart function was monitored by echocardiography. Left ventricular end-systolic and diastolic volumes, as well as cardiac output, were impaired in PO animals compared with baseline. VNS mitigated these effects. Metagenetic analysis was then performed using 16S rRNA sequencing to identify bacterial genera present in fecal samples. The abundance of 10 genera was significantly altered by PO, 8 of which were mitigated in animals receiving either left-or right-sided VNS. Metatranscriptomics analyses indicate that the abundance of genera that express genes associated with ATP-binding cassette transport and amino sugar/nitrogen metabolism was significantly changed following PO. These gut flora changes were not observed in PO animals subjected to VNS. These data suggest that VNS prevents aberrant gut flora following PO, which could contribute to its beneficial effects in heart failure patients.",0193-1857,NA,10.1152/ajpgi.00218.2016

In this study, we have decided to evaluate the effect of aqueous seed extract of G. kola at the doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg body weight on sexual behaviour of male rats. Male rats weighing 215.00 +/- 18.58 g were randomized completely into four groups (A-D) of six animals each. Animals in group A received, orally, 0.5 ml of distilled water only while those in groups B, C and D received same volume containing 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg body weight of the seed extract respectively. Frequencies of mount (MF), intromission (IF), genital toilet (GTF) and ejaculation (EF) as well as latencies of mount (ML), intromission (IL) and ejaculation (EL) were evaluated following the pairing of male rats (1: 1) with non-oestrous female rats. The parameters were monitored for the first (15-30 min), second (75-90 min) and third (180195 min) observatory periods. The levels of testosterone, luteinizing (LH) and follicle stimulating hormones (FSH) were also determined. Phytochemical screening of the extract revealed the presence of saponins (2.78\%), cardiac glycosides (0.26\%), cardenolides and dienolides (0.24\%), flavonoids (1.28\%) and steroids (1.14\%). The 25 and 100 mg/kg body weight increased (P {\textless} 0.05) the MF whereas the ML was decreased by all the doses of the extract.

Renal histology, inulin clearance, DTH responses to RTA, and IgG antibody responses to RTA were monitored as endpoints of the study. Our results demonstrated that Group III and IV animals had significantly less severe renal injury, as assessed by inulin clearance and extent of renal cortical involvement by mononuclear cells. Group II and TV animals had suppressed DTH responses, and only Group IV animals had significantly depressed antigen-specific IgG serum titers. Group III animals had neither suppressed DTH responses or IgG titers. We conclude that oral administration of tubular antigen can modulate the intensity of interstitial nephritis produced by immunization, but that the regulatory mechanism is not dependent (at all doses of fed antigen) on suppressed DTH reactivity to RTA or suppressed antigen-specific IgG.",0085-2538,NA,10.1038/ki.1997.388
hall_essential_1998,INFECTION AND IMMUNITY,An essential role for interleukin-5 and eosinophils in helminth-induced airway hyperresponsiveness,"Infection with the parasitic helminth Brugia malayi can result in development of a severe asthmatic response termed tropical pulmonary eosinophilia, This disease, thought to result from a host inflammatory response to blood parasites which become trapped in the lung microvasculature, is characterized by a profound eosinophilic infiltration into the lungs. Recruitment of eosinophils also correlates with the development of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to cholinergic agonists and severe asthmatic symptoms. Our studies examined the role of interleukin-5 (IL-5) in helminth-induced pulmonary eosinophilia and AHR. C57BL/6 mice immunized with killed B, malayi microfilariae and challenged intravenously with live microfilariae exhibit many of the characteristics of human disease, including peripheral and pulmonary eosinophilia, Cells recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage of sensitized mice consisted of 3.8\% eosinophils on day 1 postchallenge and 84\% on day 10, Extracellular major basic protein was present on the surface of airway epithelial cells as early as day 1 and continued to be evident after 8 days, indicating sustained activation and degranulation of eosinophils in the lung. These histologic changes correlated with the development of AHR to carbachol, In contrast to immunocompetent mice, immunization and challenge with B, malayi in IL-5(-/-) mice did not induce peripheral or pulmonary eosinophilia, and these mice failed to show AHR in response to cholinergic agonists. Taken together, these data indicate that IL-5 and eosinophils are required for the induction of AHR by filarial helminths.",0019-9567,NA,NA

Because MOPV is not known to cause human disease, it offers a unique alternative for studying Lassa virus transmission. We investigated how habitat, population density, and host characteristics are related to MOPV occurrence in M. natalensis populations in Morogoro, Tanzania. In 3 contrasting habitats, 511 M. natalensis individuals were trapped, 12.1\% (58/480 tested individuals) of which tested seropositive for antibodies and 8.4\% (41/489 tested individuals) for MOPV-RNA. Although population densities differ among habitats, density and habitat were not significantly correlated to MOPV-RNA or antibody presence. Antibody presence was not significantly correlated with any host characteristics. In contrast, MOPV-RNA presence was inversely related to weight, age, sexual maturity, and body mass index. The model with body mass index as predictor was the best at predicting infection probability. Thirty-five individuals were exclusively MOPV-RNA positive, 52 were exclusively antibody positive, and 6 were both MOPV-RNA and antibody positive. Interpreting these data using experimental infection results from studies on other arenaviruses, this would mean that these infections were very recent, old, and roughly 1-3 weeks after infection, respectively. The higher RNA prevalence in juveniles implies vertical transmission, or that horizontal transmission occurs mainly in this age group due to lack of immunity, higher susceptibility, and/or higher juvenile contact rates. This study demonstrates the strength of combining information on antibody and RNA presence with host characteristics, and how this information can provide valuable insights into transmission dynamics.",1530-3667,NA,10.1089/vbz.2010.0010

Antibodies to T. gondii were detected in 85 (38.8\%, 95\% CI: 32.36\%-45.26\%) of the HIV-infected patients and in 30 (20.8\%, 95\% CI: 14.20\%-27.46\%) of the AHIs. Among the AIHs, males represented 22.0\% of infections compared to females (20.0\%) and individuals within age group 21-30 years accounted for the highest prevalence of 33.3\% (95\% CI: 11.56\%-55.10\%). There was no significant difference in the trend (Chi-square, P {\textless} or = 0.05). Assessment of epidemiological factors showed higher seroprevalence of Toxoplasma antibodies among those who eat rodents (29.6\%) and those who constantly have contact with the soil (21.2\%). Among the HIV-infected, individuals 31-40-years-old had the highest T. gondii seroprevalence (36.5\%). Evaluation of the clinical findings of patients with concomitant toxoplasmosis and HIV infection greatly implicated fever (63.5\%), headache (44.7\%), rashes (41.2\%) and anorexia (34.1\%). This study contributes to the development of guidelines for the prevention and management of toxoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients and in apparently healthy individuals in a resource scarce setting.",0048-2951,NA,NA

Microtubule-organizing centres (MTOCs) at both ends and near the middle of each cell act in concert during control of microtubule positioning. In addition, the three cell surface-associated microtubule-organizing centres are involved in coordinating the connection of bundle microtubules to cytoskeletal components in neighbouring cells and to a basement membrane. The precisely defined locations of the three MTOCs specify the cell surface regions where microtubule ends will finally be anchored, The MTOCs are modified as anchorage proceeds. Substantial fibrous meshworks assemble at the surface sites occupied by the MTOCs and link microtubule ends to cell junctions. This procedure also connects the microtubule bundle to cytoskeletal arrays in neighbouring cells at two of the MTOC sites, and to the basilar membrane (a substantial basement membrane) in the case of the third site. A fourth meshwork that is not positioned at a major MTOC site is involved in connecting one side of the microtubule bundle to the cytoskeletons of two other cell neighbours, The term surfoskelosome is suggested for such concentrations of specialized cytoskeletal materials and junctions at cell surface anchorages for cytoskeletal arrays. The large microtubule bundle in each cell is composed of two closely aligned microtubule arrays, Bundle assembly begins with nucleation of microtubules by a centrosomal MTOC that is attached to the apical cell surface, These microtubules elongate downwards and the plus ends of many of them are apparently captured by a basal MTOC that is attached to the plasma membrane at the bottom of the cell, In the lower portion of the cell, the microtubule bundle also includes a basal array of microtubules but these elongate in the opposite direction, This investigation provides evidence that they extend upwards from the basal MTOC to be captured by a medial MTOC which is attached to the plasma membrane and situated near the mid-level of the cell, However, there are substantial indications that the basal array's microtubules are also nucleated by the apically situated centrosomal MTOC, but escape from it, and are translocated downwards for capture of their plus ends by the basal MTOC, If this is the case, then these microtubules continue to elongate after translocation and extend back up to the medial MTOC, which captures their minus ends.",0021-9533,NA,NA
ambali_toxicological_2008,Pakistan journal of biological sciences : PJBS,Toxicological screening of lyophilized extract of some {Nigerian} wild mushrooms in mice.,"Mushrooms are macrofungi widely consumed as food. However, many mushrooms rot away in the wild because of fear of toxicity. Therefore, lyophilized aqueous extracts of 6 mushroom species collected from Zaria, Nigeria and taxonomically identified as Chlorophyllum molybdites, Panaeolus subalteatus, Macrolepiota procera, Leucopaxillus albissmus, Hygrophoropsis aurantiacus and Pholiota aurea were screened for toxicity in mice. Lyophilized aqueous extract of each of these mushrooms was administered to three groups of 3 mice intraperitoneally (i.p.) at doses of 100, 1000 and 10, 000 mg kg(-1), respectively. Another group of three mice given distilled water served as control. The mice were examined for clinical signs of toxicity over a period of 72 h and pathological examinations conducted on dead animals. The severity of clinical signs, onset of death and pathological lesions were dose dependent. Death occurred within 10 min in all the mice dosed at 10,000 mg kg(-1) with the lyophilized extracts of all the mushrooms screened, with the exception of that of H. aurantiacus, which produced death 21-23 h post administration. This result showed that all the screened mushrooms, including the popular edible M. procera were found toxic. Therefore, since all the mushrooms screened were found toxic, it is recommended that extreme caution should be exercised in their consumption. Furthermore, in view of the regional differences in the toxicity of mushrooms, there is the need to screen more wild mushrooms found in Nigeria for toxicity. This will boost mushroom mycophagy, reduce poisoning incidence and reduce wastage of edible mushrooms in the wild.",1028-8880,NA,NA
saxon_transtympanic_2001,NEUROREPORT,Transtympanic tetrodotoxin alters the {VOR} and {Fos} labeling in the vestibular complex,"The sodium channel blocker tetrocdotoxin (TTX) is an effective tool for blockade of action potentials. Unilateral transtympanic administration of 3 mM TTX produced behavioral symptoms similar to those following unilateral peripheral vestibular ablation. Complete resolution of visible symptoms occurred between 48 and 72 h post-TTX. Eye-coil recordings indicated a spontaneous nystagmus and a decrease in the VOR in TTX-treated animals. Neuronal activity in the central vestibular complex (VC), as monitored with Fos immunocytochemistry, revealed an asymmetric pattern of Fos labeling in the medial, inferior and superior vestibular nuclei and the prepositus hypoglossal nucleus. Although the spatio-temporal pattern of Fos labeling was consistent and reproducible at each time-point, changes were noted among time-points. Transient blockade with TTX may be useful for studying the central vestibular response to recurrent or episodic vestibular disruption in the intact system.

kang_molecular_2011,VIROLOGY JOURNAL,"Molecular evolution of {Azagny} virus, a newfound hantavirus harbored by the {West} {African} pygmy shrew ({Crocidura} obscurior) in {Cote} d'{Ivoire","Background: Tanganya virus (TGNV), the only shrew-associated hantavirus reported to date from sub-Saharan Africa, is harbored by the Therese's shrew (Crocidura theresae), and is phylogenetically distinct from Thottapalayam virus (TPMV) in the Asian house shrew (Suncus murinus) and Imjin virus (MJNV) in the Ussuri white-toothed shrew (Crocidura lasiura). The existence of myriad soricid-borne hantaviruses in Eurasia and North America would predict the presence of additional hantaviruses in sub-Saharan Africa, where multiple shrew lineages have evolved and diversified. Methods: Lung tissues, collected in RNAlater (R), from 39 Buettikofer's shrews (Crocidura buettikoferi), 5 Jouvenet's shrews (Crocidura jouvenetae), 9 West African pygmy shrews (Crocidura obscurior) and 21 African giant shrews (Crocidura olivieri) captured in Cote d'Ivoire during 2009, were systematically examined for hantavirus RNA by RT-PCR. Results: A genetically distinct hantavirus, designated Azagny virus (AZGV), was detected in the West African pygmy shrew. Phylogenetic analysis of the S, M and L segments, using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods, under the GTR+I+Gamma model of evolution, showed that AZGV shared a common ancestry with TGNV and was more closely related to hantaviruses harbored by soricine shrews than to TPMV and MJNV. That is, AZGV in the West African pygmy shrew, like TGNV in the Therese's shrew, did not form a monophyletic group with TPMV and MJNV, which were deeply divergent and basal to other rodent-and soricomorph-borne hantaviruses. Ancestral distributions of each hantavirus lineage, reconstructed using Mesquite 2.74, suggested that the common ancestor of all hantaviruses was most likely of Eurasian, not African, origin. Conclusions: Genome-wide analysis of many more hantaviruses from sub-Saharan Africa are required to better understand how the biogeographic origin and radiation of African shrews might have contributed to, or have resulted from, the evolution of hantaviruses.",NA,NA,10.1186/1743-422X-8-373
kalu_effect_1983,Veterinary parasitology,Effect of trypanocides on jugular concentration of {Trypanosoma} congolense in the {West} {African} dwarf sheep.,"The effects of various trypanocides on parasitaemia was investigated in sheep experimentally-infected with Trypanosoma congolense strain 58/98. Intravenous injection of Berenil at the height of the first parasitaemic wave increased jugular parasite concentration by 12 and 16 times at the 9th and 20th minute post-treatment, respectively. With Pentamidine, maximum counts were 5.0-8.6 times zero-time concentration during the same periods. Peak effects of Samorin, Novidium and Ethidium were observed between the 60th and 90th minutes after drug administration and were 9.5, 6.3 and 3.5 times initial values, respectively. Injection of trypanocides resulted in double peaks of parasitaemia in which the second was usually higher than the first, except with Antrypol and Germanin which had no significant effect on parasitaemia. The amplitude, but not the onset of the increase in parasitaemia in sheep, was found to be related to the therapeutic efficacy of the trypanocides in the treatment of Trypanosoma congolense infection in rats. Animals treated with the diamidines (Berenil and Pentamidine) exhibited apparent parasitologic cure of infection in sheep two to four days after treatment. However, administration of any of the drugs one week after the first treatment resulted in flushing of cryptic trypanosomes into the jugular vein and counts as high as 7.63 X 10(3) microliter -1 were observed within ten minutes with Berenil. It is suggested that besides their therapeutic use, the diamidines may be of value in the parasitologic diagnosis of sub-patent trypanosomiasis due to Trypanosoma congolense.",0304-4017,NA,NA
gibbons_alpha1h_2009,JOURNAL OF CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR MEDICINE,The alpha({1H}) {Ca2}+channel subunit is expressed in mouse jejunal interstitial cells of {Cajal} and myocytes,"T-type Ca2+ currents have been detected in cells from the external muscular layers of gastrointestinal smooth muscles and appear to contribute to the generation of pacemaker potentials in interstitial cells of Cajal from those tissues. However, the Ca2+ channel alpha subunit responsible for these currents has not been determined. We established that the alpha subunit of the alpha(1H) Ca2+ channel is expressed in single myocytes and interstitial cells of Cajal using reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction from whole tissue, laser capture microdissected tissue and single cells isolated from the mouse jejunum. Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings demonstrated that a nifedipine and Cd2+ resistant, mibefradil-sensitive current is present in myocytes dissociated from the jejunum. Electrical recordings from the circular muscle layer demonstrated that mibefradil reduced the frequency and initial rate of rise of the electrical slow wave. Gene targeted knockout of both alleles of the cacna1h gene, which encodes the alpha(1H) Ca2+ channel subunit, resulted in embryonic lethality because of death of the homozygous knockouts prior to E13.5 days in utero. We conclude that a channel with the pharmacological and molecular characteristics of the alpha(1H) Ca2+ channel subunit is expressed in interstitial cells of Cajal and myocytes from the mouse jejunum, and that ionic conductances through the alpha(1H) Ca2+ channel contribute to the upstroke of the pacemaker potential. Furthermore, the survival of mice that do not express the alpha(1H) Ca2+ channel protein is dependent on the genetic background and targeting approach used to generate the knockout mice.",NA,NA,10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00623.x
mellott_multiple_2011,NEUROSCIENCE,MULTIPLE} {ORIGINS} {OF} {CHOLINERGIC} {INNERVATION} {OF} {THE} {COCHLEAR} {NUCLEUS,"Acetylcholine (Ach) affects a variety of cell types in the cochlear nucleus (CN) and is likely to play a role in numerous functions. Previous work in rats suggested that the acetylcholine arises from cells in the superior olivary complex, including cells that have axonal branches that innervate both the CN and the cochlea (i.e. olivocochlear cells) as well as cells that innervate only the CN. We combined retrograde tracing with immunohistochemistry for choline acetyltransferase to identify the source of ACh in the CN of guinea pigs. The results confirm a projection from cholinergic cells in the superior olivary complex to the CN. In addition, we identified a substantial number of cholinergic cells in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT) and the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT) that project to the CN. On average, the PPT and LDT together contained about 26\% of the cholinergic cells that project to CN, whereas the superior olivary complex contained about 74\%. A small number of additional cholinergic cells were located in other areas, including the parabrachial nuclei. The results highlight a substantial cholinergic projection from the pontomesencephalic tegmentum (PPT and LDT) in addition to a larger projection from the superior olivary complex. These different sources of cholinergic projections to the CN are likely to serve different functions. Projections from the superior olivary complex are likely to serve a feedback role, and may be closely tied to olivocochlear functions. Projections from the pontomesencephalic tegmentum may play a role in such things as arousal and sensory gating. Projections from each of these areas, and perhaps even the smaller sources of cholinergic inputs, may be important in conditions such as tinnitus as well as in normal acoustic processing.

rizkalla_incorporating_2012,Canadian Journal of Zoology,Incorporating behavior-based indices of connectivity into spatially explicit population models.,"Measuring connectivity in fragmented landscapes remains a central problem in ecology. Connectivity metrics range from descriptors of landscape structure to direct observations of a species' ability to move to and colonize a forest patch. We constructed individual-based spatially explicit population models for a guild of forest rodents in Indiana to test the ability of structural and actual, or behavioral, measures of connectivity to predict patch and landscape occupancy and abundance. Model accuracy was assessed using comparisons with data from trapping studies. Predicted abundances within patches correlated with empirical data for five out of six species, but predicted patterns of patch occupancy corresponded with observations for only one species. Discrepancies may be due to inaccurate parameter values or the absence from the models of ecological processes such as conspecific attraction and competition. Nonetheless, the models demonstrated the utility of patch immigration as a measure of connectivity in explaining population abundance in fragmented landscapes. We discuss potential methods of collecting these behavior-based data.",0008-4301,NA,NA

Consequently three ecological zones namely: 1.zone of stable urban centre, 2.zone of rapid urban transformation, and 3.zone of undisturbed rural centre were mapped out with three ecological subsets from each zone. These subsets include; site A-undisturbed landscape area, site B-stable human settlement area and site C-refuse dump site area. Standard trapping procedures were then adopted using bread and raw cassava as baits. A total of 1411 black rats were caught in 1002 trap nights representing a mean trap success of 46.9\%. The relative abundance of rats caught were highest in zone 2 with 46.4\% and lowest in zone 1 with 11.9\%. An analysis of variance indicated that there was a significant difference in the abundance of rats in the various study zones( Fcal = 1.626, MSE = 21168.11, p{\textless}0.05). A Post Hoc analysis also shows a significant difference on the influence of site structure on black rat population. It is therefore worthwhile to conclude that black rat can be used as bioindicator to monitor the ecosystem health in an environment of growing human population.",NA,NA,NA

Skin absorption was determined for 48 hr after exposure using an in vitro flow-through system. Skin absorption was calculated from the sum of the percentage recovery of C-14 activity in the receiver solution and the percentage recovery in the methanol washes of the skin at 48 hr and the skin digest samples. Two receiver solutions, Ringer's saline, and Hanks' HEPES buffered saline with 4\% serum albumin were used. Listed in decreasing order, the total percentage in vitro dermal absorptions obtained by 48 hr after exposure for the five skin types were: 47 +/- 4.3\% [tissue cultured Testskin; Hanks' receiver (HR)], 40 +/- 4.5\% (rat; HR), 19 +/- 1.8\% (human; HR), 14 +/- 2.3\% (hairless guinea pig; HR), 14 +/- 8.8\% (pig; Ringer's receiver). The percentage recovery of the radiolabel in soapy water skin washes at 24 hr, methanol washes and skin digests at 48 hr, and of C-14-labelled volatiles collected in air traps at 48 hr after exposure are reported. Comparative in vivo studies were conducted for 14 days after exposure and demonstrated 32 +/- 3.9 and 28 +/- 7.8\% recovery of C-14 in the urine of rats (dose rate, 3 mu g/cm(2)) and guinea pigs (dose rate, 4 mu g/cm(2)), respectively. Total faecal recovery was 2 +/- 0.3 and 9 +/- 3.5\% for rats and guinea pigs, respectively. Analysis of tissue taken at autopsy 14 days after dosing demonstrated a total tissue recovery of C-14 activity of 1 +/- 0.1 and 2 +/- 0.5\% in rats and guinea pigs, respectively. Including the C-14 activity extracted from the skin removed from the dose site at 14 days after exposure. the total recovery of dermally absorbed residues was 49 +/- 10.4 and 40 +/- 9.9\% in rats and guinea pigs, respectively. Recovery of C-14 activity from soapy water skin washes conducted at 24 hr after exposure was 28 +/- 8.1 and 43 +/- 9.0\% for rats and guinea pigs, respectively. Recovery in skin patches was 18\% (guinea pigs) and 26\% (rats). In summary, the in vitro/in vivo concordance for the rat dermal absorption data was good but the in vitro data for hairless guinea pigs underestimated the in vivo absorption, and therefore for 2,4-D, rat skin may provide a better model of percutaneous absorption.",0887-2333,NA,10.1016/0887-2333(94)90112-0
viviano_blessing_2020-1,TROPICAL ZOOLOGY,"Blessing the rains down in {Africa}: spatiotemporal behaviour of the crested porcupine {Hystrix} cristuta ({Mammalia}: {Rodentia}) in the rainy and dry seasons, in the {African} savannah","The assessment of habitat selection and temporal patterns of activity rhythms is paramount for wildlife conservation. Studies on behavioural ecology of wild mammals are particularly challenging in tropical areas, mostly when involving rare or elusive species. Despite being a common species in Italy, the crested porcupine Hystrix cristata is threatened of extinction throughout most of its sub-Saharan range. All available information on the ecology of this species has been collected in Italy, whereas no data is present in the scientific literature on spatiotemporal behaviour of this large rodent in Africa. In this work, we attempted to determine habitat selection and temporal patterns of activity rhythms of the crested porcupine in northern Benin and neighbouring countries, through intensive camera-trapping. We collected a total of 146 records of crested porcupine, 91 in the dry season (October-March) and 55 in the rainy season (April-September). Porcupines used most habitats in proportion to their local availability, while selecting rock outcrop formations (possibly used as shelter sites) and avoiding open areas, wetlands and gallery forests. A mostly nocturnal behaviour was confirmed throughout the year, with some diurnal activity at the start and at the end of the rainy season. The importance of rains in determining birth peak has been also showed, with juvenile individuals always observed at the start and at the end of the rainy season. Full moon always inhibited activity of this large rodent, most likely evolved as an antipredatory behaviour to limit encounters with potential predators (common leopard Panthera pardus, spotted hyaena Crocuta crocuta and honey badger Mellivora capensis) and humans. Poaching pressure towards porcupines in West Africa is strong. Porcupines are killed for the traditional medicine, for their meat and because they are widely considered as a crop pest. This assessment should therefore be used as a basic tool to design conservation plans to preserve this rodent species in its native range.",0394-6975,NA,10.4081/tz.2020.80

gassama_ordinary_2001,International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,Ordinary and opportunistic enteropathogens associated with diarrhea in {Senegalese} adults in relation to human immunodeficiency virus serostatus.,"OBJECTIVES: A survey was conducted in Dakar, Senegal, to identify major types and prevalences of bacteria, parasites, fungi, and Rotaviruses associated with diarrhea in relation to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serostatus with the goal to provide guidance to physicians for case management., METHODS: Etiologic agents were identified in a case control study: cases were HIV-infected patients with diarrhea (HIV+ D+) and HIV seronegative patients with diarrhea (HIV D+); controls were HIV-infected patients without diarrhea (HIV+ D ) and seronegative controls without diarrhea (HID D ). Ordinary enteric pathogens were identified by conventional methods. Different Escherichia coli pathotypes were characterized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), identification of HEp-2 cell adherence pattern, Sereny test, GM1-ELISA, and the suckling mouse assay. Opportunistic parasites, such as Cryptosporidium and Microsporidium, were identified by the Kinyoun method and trichromic stain of Weber, respectively. Rotaviruses were identified with a commercial latex agglutination kit. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by the disk diffusion method., RESULTS: Among the 594 patients examined, 158 were HIV+ D+, 121 were HIV2 D+, 160 were HIV+ D , and 155 were HIV D . The main etiologies of diarrhea were different according to HIV serostatus of patients. In immunocompetent adults the main causes of diarrhea were Shigella sp (12.4\%), Entamoeba histolytica(10.7\%), Salmonella enterica (6.6\%), and Giardia (4.9\%). In the immunocompromised host the more frequent pathogens were enteroaggregative E. coli (19.6\%), Microsporidium (9.4\%), Cryptosporidium sp (8.2\%), Rotavirus (8.2\%), Shigella sp (7.6\%), Candida albicans (7.6\%), E. histolytica (5.1\%), S. enterica (4.4\%), and Isospora belli (4.4\%). Also, Blastocystis hominis has to be considered as an opportunistic parasite, because it was identified only in HIV-infected patients, with higher prevalence in adults with diarrhea (2.5\% in HIV+ D+ patients; 0.6\% in HIV+ D patients). High level of asymptomatic carriage of Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura and some cases of multiple infections were observed. Fungi, Cryptosporidium sp and Microsporidium sp, were often identified in patients with low CD4 counts (range, 79 250 cells/mL). Independently from HIV-serostatus, CD4 count was lower in diarrheic persons, suggesting that diarrhea is a debilitating illness and that effective management of diarrhea can prevent immunosuppression. Isolated enteropathogenic strains displayed high resistance to most antibiotics used in Senegal for treating diarrhea (ampicillin, tetracycline, cotrimoxazole); they were susceptible to amikacin, gentamicin, and norfloxacin., CONCLUSION: These epidemiologic data suggest that guidelines for the management of diarrhea during HIV infection in Dakar should be updated.",1201-9712,NA,NA
omotainse_erythrocyte_1992,Revue d'elevage et de medecine veterinaire des pays tropicaux,Erythrocyte response to {Trypanosoma} brucei in experimentally infected dogs.,"Trypanosoma brucei infection produced an acute and fatal disease in Nigerian mongrel dogs due to a rapidly developing anaemia. Infected dogs responded with increased reticulocytosis, which was not sustained with chronicity. In comparison the response to artificially-induced haemolytic anaemia was progressive, marked and sustained. The anaemia of T. brucei infection of dogs was either normocytic normochromic in acute infection or microcytic normochromic in chronic infection. Artificially-induced haemolytic anaemia was either macrocytic normochromic or normocytic normochromic. The erythropoietic potential of plasma in vivo in mice increased in T. brucei-infected dogs except at the terminal parasitaemia. The anaemia in Trypanosoma brucei-infected dogs is therefore initially responsive but becomes poorly involved with chronicity.",0035-1865,NA,NA
adewale_evaluation_2016,JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY,Evaluation of acute and subacute toxicity of aqueous extract of {Crassocephalum} rubens leaves in rats,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: Crassocephalum rubens is found throughout tropical Africa including the Indian Ocean islands. The leaves are commonly eaten in form of soups and sauces in South-Western Nigeria, also in other humid zones of Africa. Traditionally, it is used as an antidote against any form of poisoning; used to treat stomach and liver complaints; and externally to treat burns, sore eyes, earache, leprosy and breast cancer. In this study, acute and subacute toxicity of aqueous extract of C. rubens leaves was evaluated in rats in order to assess its safety profile. Materials and methods: In acute toxicity study, rats were given a single oral administration of aqueous extract of C rubens leaves at graded doses (250-5000 mg/kg). The animals were monitored for behavioural changes and possible mortality over a period of 24 h and thereafter, for 14 days. In the subacute toxicity study, rats of both sexes were administered C. rubens orally at doses of 250 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg, 750 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg body weight daily, for 28 days. Rats were observed weekly for any changes in general behaviour and body weights. In addition, other relevant parameters were assayed at the end of the main and reversibility study periods. Results: There was no observed adverse effect; including mortality in the animals. The extract caused no significant difference in the body weights as well as organs weights of treated groups when compared with the control groups. Haematological and biochemical parameters also revealed no toxic effects of the extract on rats. Histological assessments were normal in liver and kidney. Conclusions: It can therefore be suggested based on the results from this study that aqueous extract of C rubens leaves, at dosage levels up to 1000 mg/kg, is non-toxic and could also offer protection on some body tissues. Aqueous extract of C rubens could therefore, be considered safe. This study supports the application of Crassocephalum rubens in traditional medicine. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Blood samples were taken for chiral gas chromatographic analysis of the concentrations of nerve agent stereoisomers and for measurement of the progressive inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The animals were exposed for 4-8 min to 0.4-0.8 LCt50 of C(+/-)P(+/-)soman. Concentrations of the P(-)-isomers increased rapidly during exposure, up to several nanograms per milliliter of blood. Mathematical equations describing the concentration-time courses of the P(-)-isomers were obtained by nonlinear regression. The kinetics were mathematically described as a discontinuous process, with a monoexponential equation for the exposure period and a two-exponential equation for the postexposure period. The absorption phase of C(+)P(-)-soman lagged behind that of the C(-)P(-)-isomer, presumably due to preferential covalent binding at as yet unidentified binding sites. The terminal half-life observed after nose-only exposure is longer than that observed after an equitoxic iv bolus administration, which suggests the presence of a depot in the upper respiratory tract from which absorption continues after termination of the exposure. Two types of nonlinearity of the toxicokinetics were observed, i.e., with dose and with exposure time. The AChE activity was rapidly inhibited during exposure to the nerve agent vapor. There were no soman-related effects on RMV and RF. The toxicokinetics of the soman stereoisomers observed for nose-only exposure are compared with those determined for iv bolus and sc administration.

oboegbulem_salmonellae_1990,Journal of wildlife diseases,Salmonellae in the {African} great cane rat ({Thryonomys} swinderianus).,"Because of its large size, the African great cane rat (Thryonomys swinderianus) is valued for food and has become a popular meat in western Africa. A survey was conducted to determine the occurrence of salmonellae in cane rats. Ten strains of Salmonella sp. were isolated from eight of 25 (32\%) cane rats. Salmonella ajiobo was isolated from the spleen and intestines of three cane rats; S. agama was obtained from the spleen, liver and intestines of three animals; and S. poona was isolated from the spleen and liver of two cane rats. The occurrence of salmonellae in T. swinderianus is a potential public health hazard. Humans may become exposed to infection by consumption of inadequately cooked infected cane rat meat, or by eating vegetables, sugar cane and fruits contaminated with excretions of carrier cane rats. Incidents of human salmonellosis attributable to cane rat meat have not yet been reported; however, all three serotypes isolated from the cane rats have also been isolated from stools of patients suffering from gastroenteritis in Nigeria.",0090-3558,NA,NA
abernathy_utility_2015,JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGICAL AND TOXICOLOGICAL METHODS,Utility of the auditory brainstem response evaluation in non-clinical drug safety evaluations,"Introduction: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires thorough evaluation of the potential safety hazards of all new drugs, food additives, and therapeutic devices that are intended for human use. Drugs that are otically administered (i.e., ear drops), or are known to systemically distribute to the inner ear, require additional specialized safety testing to ensure that the drug does not permanently impair auditory function. Methods: To properly determine a drug's impact on auditory function, the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research requires the use of the Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) evaluation. The ABR evaluation uses auditory stimuli evoked potentials to assess function by establishing minimum intensity thresholds. These thresholds can be monitored following drug treatment to determine an impact on hearing loss. This review discusses methodical considerations for conducting ABR evaluations as they apply to specialized drug safety studies. Alternative assays are discussed and compared to the utility of the ABR evaluation. Conclusions: The ABR evaluation provides reliable and sensitive measures of hearing function that are suitable for definitive drug safety evaluations or hazardous risk assessments.

hagen_retention_2016,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY AND ANIMAL NUTRITION,Retention of solute and particle markers in the digestive tract of chinchillas ({Chinchilla} laniger),"The chinchilla (Chinchilla laniger) is a herbivorous hystricomorph South American rodent for which no mean digesta retention times have been reported so far. Six animals (mean body mass +/- standard deviation: 513 +/- 99g) on a diet of grass hay and lucerne-based pellets were given a pulse dose of a solute (cobalt-EDTA) and a particle (chromium-mordanted fibre, {\textless}2mm) marker with subsequent frequent faecal collection. Dry matter intake was 45.2 +/- 8.0g/kg(0.75)/day. Mean retention times were 22.2 +/- 5.3h for solutes and 25.4 +/- 5.2h for particles, with the difference being not significant within individuals. This indicates the presence of a mucus-trap' colonic separation mechanism, which is in accord with morphological descriptions of the typical colonic furrow in chinchillas. Corresponding to a strategy of colonic digesta separation and caecotroph formation, secondary marker excretion peaks indicated coprophagic events that were spaced approximately 12h apart. Given that these retention times appear longer than measures reported for rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) or guinea pigs (Cavia procellus), it would be interesting to compare the digestive efficiency of chinchillas on high levels of dietary fibre to other species.",0931-2439,NA,10.1111/jpn.12441

We investigated the levels of heavy metal concentrations in the tissues as well as the effect of BLCO on the antioxidant status of erythrocytes of rats after oral exposure to 0, 200 and 800 mg/kg BLCO for 7 days. Analysis of heavy metal concentrations in BLCO showed that Zn {\textgreater} Fe {\textgreater} Pb {\textgreater} Cu {\textgreater} Ni. The trend of accumulation of the metals in the tissues is blood-Fe {\textgreater} Pb {\textgreater}Zn whereas Cu and Ni levels were not affected; Liver-Ni {\textgreater} Zn {\textgreater} Fe {\textgreater} Cu {\textgreater} Pb and Testes-Ni {\textgreater} Cu {\textgreater} Pb {\textgreater} Zn {\textgreater} Fe. The order of concentration of the metals in the tissues is as follows: iron-blood {\textgreater} liver {\textgreater} testes; zinc-liver {\textgreater} blood {\textgreater} testes; lead-blood {\textgreater} liver {\textgreater} testes; copper-testes {\textgreater} liver {\textgreater} blood; nickel-liver {\textgreater} testes {\textgreater} blood. Activities of the antioxidant enzymes of erythrocytes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione peroxidase increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner with significant elevation in hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde levels, whereas glutathione level was not significantly decreased in BLCO-treated animals.

wenzel_helper-dependent_2007,OTOLOGY \& NEUROTOLOGY,Helper-dependent adenovirus-mediated gene transfer into the adult mouse cochlea,"Background: Gene therapy may provide a way to restore cochlear function to deaf patients. The most successful techniques for cochlear gene therapy have been injection of early-generation adenoviral vectors into scala media in guinea pigs. However, it is important to be able to perform gene therapy research in mice because there is wide availability of transgenic strains with hereditary hearing loss. Purpose: We demonstrate our technique for delivery of a third-generation adenoviral vector, helper-dependent adenovirus (HDAd), to the adult mouse cochlea. Methods: Mice were injected with an HDAd that contained a reporter gene for either P-galactosidase or green fluorescent protein into scala media. After 4 days, the cochleae were harvested for analyses. Auditory brainstem response monitoring of cochlear function was performed before making a cochleostomy, after making a cochleostomy, and before killing the animal. Results: beta-Galactosidase was identified in the spiral ligament, the organ of Corti, and spiral ganglion cells by light microscopy. Green fluorescent protein epifluorescence was assessed in whole-mount organ of Corti preparations using confocal microscopy. This demonstrated transduction of inner hair cells, outer hair cells, and supporting cells. Paraffin-embedded cross sections similarly revealed gene transduction within the organ of Corti. Threshold shifts of 39.8 +/- 5.4 and 37.7 +/- 5.5 dB were observed in mice injected with HDAd or control buffer, respectively. Conclusion: The technique of scala media HDAd injection reliably infects the adult mouse cochlea, including cells within the organ of Corti, although the procedure itself adversely affects hearing.",1531-7129,NA,10.1097/MAO.0b013e318158973f

Here we report the basic response properties of SPN units acquired with extracellular recording techniques under monaural acoustic stimulation in the Mongolian gerbil. Poststimulus-time histograms corresponded to those described earlier for the cat's cochlear nucleus (onset, chopper, primary-like), and partly to those previously acquired in other SOC nuclei (tonic, off/rebound). Two-thirds of the units responded solely to contralateral stimulation (40\% excitatory [E], 19\% inhibitory [I], 6\% mixed [EI]). Most of the remainder responded equally to stimulation from either ear (18\% I.I, 9\% E.E). Overall, the monaural contralateral input was more effective than the ipsilateral and bilateral input. Characteristic frequencies and response areas covered the entire hearing range of the gerbil and the units mostly showed broad frequency-tuning. In combination, these properties suggest that the SPN might be a constituent of an afferent pathway encoding stimulus features across broad frequency ranges. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

caicedo_glutamate-induced_1998,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE,Glutamate-induced {Co2}+ uptake in rat auditory brainstem neurons reveals developmental changes in {Ca2}+ permeability of glutamate receptors,"Ca2+ influx through glutamate receptors (GluRs) is thought to play a crucial part in developmental processes and neuronal plasticity. Here we have examined the spatiotemporal distribution of Ca2+-permeable GluRs in auditory brainstem neurons of the rat from birth to adulthood, using the cobalt-staining technique of Pruss and collaborators. In slices of young adult rats, 1 mM glutamate evoked intense cobalt uptake in subsets of neurons in the ventral cochlear nuclei, the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, the lateral and the medial superior olive, and the lateral lemniscal nuclei. Neurones in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus, and thalamic auditory nuclei appear to express few, if any, Ca2+-permeable GluRs. Thus, in adults, Ca2+-permeable GluRs are present in neurons of almost all main relay stations of the auditory brainstem. During development, cobalt-stained cells first appeared at about hearing onset (at postnatal day 12 [Pt12]). At P16, staining levels were highest and the pattern of distribution was already adult-like. The staining intensity slightly declined during the fourth postnatal week. in contrast, Ca2+-permeable receptors were detected in the external cortex of the inferior colliculus as early as P4. Our results show that auditory neurons, characterized by a high temporal precision in neuronal activity, display Ca2+-permeable GluRs. Because Ca2+ permeability appears at about the onset of hearing and is highest during the following 2 weeks, Ca2+ influx through GluRs is likely to be implicated in remodelling processes occurring during this ontogenetic period.",0953-816X,NA,10.1046/j.1460-9568.1998.00104.x
romano_priming_2006,VACCINE,Priming but not boosting with plasmid {DNA} encoding mycolyl-transferase {Ag85A} from {Mycobacterium} tuberculosis increases the survival time of {Mycobacterium} bovis {BCG} vaccinated mice against low dose intravenous challenge with {M} tuberculosis {H37Rv,"DNA vaccination is a potent means for inducing strong CD4(+) (Th1) and particularly CD8(+) mediated immune responses and protective immunity against tuberculosis infection in mice. Here we have analyzed the potential of a DNA vaccine encoding the immunodominant mycolyl-transferase Ag85A for increasing the efficacy of the current tuberculosis vaccine Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) in three long-term survival experiments. BALB/c mice were vaccinated with BCG either following DNA priming or prior to DNA boosting. Ag85A specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) mediated IFN-gamma responses were increased in mice primed with DNA prior to BCG, and in BCG vaccinated mice subsequently boosted with DNA. In the latter immunization protocol, antigenic stimulation also induced significant levels of IL-17. Mice were monitored for cachexia and survival following a low dose intravenous challenge with M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Priming with Ag85A but not control DNA increased significantly the protective efficacy of the BCG vaccine as indicated by reduced cachexia and prolonged survival time: 32 weeks versus 23 weeks in one experiment and 33 weeks versus 26 weeks in another experiment (MST in control, TB infected mice: 17 weeks in both experiments). On the other hand, boosting of BCG by subsequent Ag85A DNA in saline or vaxfectin (TM)-or recombinant 85A protein or MVA-85A for that matter - did not augment the efficacy of BCG (MST 19-21 weeks in all vaccinated groups versus 11 weeks in control, TB infected mice). Our results demonstrate that Ag85A DNA priming can increase efficacy of BCG and that boosting protocols of BCG may possibly be hampered by the induction of ThIL-17 cells. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

kuenzl_is_2003,Hormones and Behavior,Is a wild mammal kept and reared in captivity still a wild animal?,"This study compared domestic guinea pigs (Cavia aperea f. porcellus; DGP) and two different populations of the wild cavy (Cavia aperea), its ancestor, to examine whether rearing of wild mammals in captivity affects their behavior and physiological stress responses. One population of wild cavies consisted of wild-trapped animals and their first laboratory-reared offspring (WGP-1). The animals of the other population were reared in captivity for about 30 generations (WGP-30). The spontaneous behavior of each of six groups of WGP-1 and WGP-30 and nine groups of DGP, each consisting of one adult male and two adult females, was analyzed quantitatively. Blood samples of the males were taken to determine cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine concentrations. In addition, the exploratory behavior of 60-day-old male WGP-1, WGP-30, and DGP was investigated in an exploration apparatus. The domesticated animals displayed significantly less aggression, but significantly more sociopositive and male courtship behavior than their wild ancestors. In addition, DGP were much less attentive to their physical environment. Surprisingly, no behavioral difference was found between WGP-1 and WGP-30. Basal cortisol concentrations did not differ between wild and domestic guinea pigs. Catecholamine concentrations, however, as well as the challenge values of cortisol, were distinctly reduced in the DGP. WGP-1 and WGP-30 did not differ with respect to their endocrine stress responses. In the exploration apparatus both forms of wild cavies were much more explorative than the domestic animals. These data suggest that the long-term breeding and rearing of wild guinea pigs in captivity do not result in significant changes in behavior and hormonal stress responses. It appears to take much longer periods of time and artificial selection by humans to bring about characters of domestication in wild animals.",0018-506X,NA,10.1016/S0018-506X(02)00017-X

Here we extend the stability and attenuation studies of the promising tuberculosis vaccine candidate based on Mycobacterium tuberculosis phoP mutant strain, SO2. Stability of the phoP mutation was tested after sub-culturing SO2 strain for 6 months in laboratory media and also after 3 months of infection in SCID mice. Results showed no reversion of the phoP mutation either in vitro or in vivo. In addition, SO2 was fully sensitive to four major first-line antituberculous drugs against tuberculosis. Safety and toxicity studies were performed in guinea pigs. Animals were infected with a quantity of SO2 equivalent to 50 vaccination doses (2.5 x 10(6) CFUs) and weight was monitored for 6 months. All animals survived and no histological lesions were found, showing full attenuation of SO2. Studies in a post-exposure model of guinea pigs and mice, previously infected with M. tuberculosis, were performed and no toxicity effects were found after inoculation of SO2. All these results together confirm that SO2 has a secure safety profile that encourages its use in clinical trials. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Using molecular tools, we assessed the prevalence of bacteria and protozoans in small mammals and their ectoparasites in Faladje, Bougouni, and Bamoko, Mali. A total of 130 small mammals belonging to 10 different species were captured, of which 74 (56.9\%) were infested by ectoparasites, including Laelaps echidnina, Xenopsylla cheopis, Amblyomma variegatum, Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato, and Haemaphysalis spp. nymphs. DNA of Bartonella was found in 14/75 (18.7\%), 6/48 (12.5\%), and 3/7 (42.8\%) small mammals from Faladje, Bougouni, and Bamako, respectively. In Faladje, Bartonella DNA was detected in 31/68 (45.6\%) of L. echidnina and 14/22 (63.6\%) of X. cheopis. In Bougouni, it was found in 2/26 (7.7\%) of L. echidnina and 10/42 (23.8\%) of X. cheopis. The sequences of Bartonella obtained from small mammals were close to those of Bartonella mastomydis, Bartonella elizabethae, and uncultured Bartonella spp. In Faladje, Coxiella burnetii DNA was detected in 64.4\% (29/45) of Haemaphysalis spp. ticks, 4.5\% (2/44) of Mastomys erythroleucus, 12.5\% (1/8) of Praomys daltoni, and 1.5\% (1/68) of L. echidnina. We found DNA of Wolbachia in X. cheopis from Faladje and DNA of Rickettsia africae and Ehrlichia ruminantium in Am. variegatum from Bougouni. The results of our study show that several small mammal species harbor and may serve as potential reservoirs of Bartonella spp., likely to play a major role in the maintenance, circulation, and potential transmission of bacteria in Mali.

Aphrodisiac plants are plants with anabolic properties i.e. they help in protein synthesis and enhances sexual abilities in males. They are also known as androgenic plants because their properties are similar to that of androgen a male hormone. Cold aqueous extract of Hibiscus rosasinensis leaves is reported by local traditional practioners in Western Nigeria to be aphrodisiac., OBJECTIVE: To investigate the anabolic properties of Hibiscus rosasinensis., MATERIALS AND METHOD: Three groups (8/group) of immature male rats of known weights were administered equal doses of aqueous (cold and hot) and alcoholic extracts of Hibiscus rosasinensis leaves for 8 weeks. The gain in body and isolated sexual organs (testis, epididymis, seminal vesicle and prostate) weights were determined after treatment and compared to the value obtained from a fourth untreated group which served as the control. Section through the testes of both the treated and untreated rats were also examined microscopically and displayed as a photomicrograph for comparism. All data were statistically analysed and displaced in graphic form., RESULTS: Over the 8 weeks of treatment, the control, the cold aqueous extract dosed, hot aqueous extract dosed and alcoholic extract dosed rats gained 8\%, 15\%, 18\% and 22\% in body weights respectively. The increase in the weight of testis, epididymis, seminal vesicle and prostate of the alcoholic extract dosed rats was 19\%, 30\%, 31\% and 40\% respectively., CONCLUSION: The anabolic effect of the leaf extracts of H. rosasinensis is hereby established.

lee_posttranscriptional_2009,JOURNAL OF PINEAL RESEARCH,Posttranscriptional regulation of pineal melatonin synthesis in {Octodon} degus,"Small laboratory animals have provided significant information about melatonin regulation, yet most of these organisms are nocturnal and regulate melatonin synthesis by mechanisms that diverge from those of humans. For example, in all rodents examined, melatonin secretion occurs with a time lag of several hours after the onset of darkness; in addition, arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT), the key enzyme in melatonin synthesis, displays dynamic transcriptional activation specifically at night in all rodents studied to date. In ungulates and primates including humans, on the other hand, melatonin secretion occurs immediately during the early night and is controlled by circadian posttranscriptional regulation of AANAT. We hypothesize that the diurnal Octodon degus (an Hystricognath rodent) could serve as an improved experimental model for studies of human melatonin regulation. To test this, we monitored melatonin production in degus using pineal microdialysis and characterized the regulation of melatonin synthesis by analyzing degu Aanat. Degu pineal melatonin rises with little latency at night, as in ungulates and primates. In addition, degu Aanat mRNA expression displays no detectable diurnal variation, suggesting that, like ungulates and primates, melatonin in this species is regulated by a posttranscriptional mechanism. Compared with AANAT from all rodents examined to date, the predicted amino acid sequence of degu AANAT is phylogenetically more closely related to ungulate and primate AANAT. These data suggest that Octodon degus may provide an ideal model system for laboratory investigation of mechanisms of melatonin synthesis and secretion in diurnal mammals.",0742-3098,NA,10.1111/j.1600-079X.2009.00690.x
adisa_relative_2015,Annals of African medicine,Relative expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin and matrix metalloproteinases-2 in ameloblastoma of a black {African} sub-population.,"BACKGROUND: Ameloblastoma although a benign odontogenic tumor, is locally invasive. The abundant presence of myofibroblasts (marked by alpha-smooth muscle actin [alpha-SMA]) in the stroma and expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in the neoplastic or stromal cells have been linked with the tumor's ability for both local and distant spread. We aim to estimate the relative expression of alpha-SMA and MMP-2 in ameloblastoma from a black African subgroup to gauge their relative potential for enhancing local invasiveness and hence, their prospects as possible chemotherapeutic targets., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks of ameloblastoma cases from Nigeria were prepared for antibody processing to alpha-SMA (Dako Monoclonal Mouse Anti-Human alpha-SMA antibody clone 1A4) and MMP-2 (Abcam Mouse Monoclonal Anti-MMP-2 antibody [CA-4001/CA719E3C] ab3158). The score for percentage positivity of the tumor cells and the score for staining intensities were then multiplied in order to generate an immunoreactive score., RESULTS: alpha-smooth muscle actin was only expressed in the fibrous connective tissues adjacent to the tumor islands while MMP-2 was expressed in the ameloblasts, stellate reticulum, and the connective tissues in varying proportions. All the variants analyzed expressed alpha-SMA mildly or moderately, except for the follicular variant that either did not express alpha-SMA or expressed it mildly. The highest number of strong immunoreactivity to MMP-2 in the ameloblast region was found in the plexiform variant., CONCLUSION: Chemotherapeutic targeting of both molecules may, therefore, be a vital step in the control of local ameloblastoma invasiveness.",0975-5764,NA,10.4103/1596-3519.152075
